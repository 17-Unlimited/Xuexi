0:an extremely unpleasant film .
3:this is one of the rarest kinds of films : a family-oriented non-disney film that is actually funny without hitting below the belt .
2:i felt sad for lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by rohmer , for example .
2:you wo n't believe much of it , but you will laugh at the audacity , at the who 's who casting and the sheer insanity of it all .

2:movies like this are selling the old european candor , the old wink of ` bold ' revelation .
4:a poignant and compelling story about relationships , food of love takes us on a bumpy but satisfying journey of the heart .
3:director alfonso cuaron gets vivid , convincing performances from a fine cast , and generally keeps things going at a rapid pace , occasionally using an omniscient voice-over narrator in the manner of french new wave films .

2:a close-to-solid espionage thriller with the misfortune of being released a few decades too late .

2:if legendary shlockmeister ed wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from anne rice 's novel the vampire chronicles .
1:that frenetic spectacle -lrb- on the tv show -rrb- has usually been leavened by a charm that 's conspicuously missing from the girls ' big-screen blowout .

1:the script is a disaster , with cloying messages and irksome characters .
1:the low-budget full frontal was one of the year 's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and solaris is its big-budget brother .

2:boisterous and daft documentary .
3:while surprisingly sincere , this average little story is adorned with some awesome action photography and surfing .

4:the story itself it mostly told through on-camera interviews with several survivors , whose riveting memories are rendered with such clarity that it 's as if it all happened only yesterday .
1:though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter .
4:some movies suck you in despite their flaws , and heaven is one such beast .

0:the thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes -lrb- of which they 'll get plenty -rrb- fills me with revulsion .
2:with elements cribbed from lang 's metropolis , welles ' kane , and eisenstein 's potemkin , the true wonder of rintarô 's metropolis is the number of lasting images all its own .
0:the movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates .

2:13 conversations may be a bit too enigmatic and overly ambitious to be fully successful , but sprecher and her screenwriting partner and sister , karen sprecher , do n't seem ever to run out of ideas .
2:it 's not a classic spy-action or buddy movie , but it 's entertaining enough and worth a look .
3:an idealistic love story that brings out the latent 15-year-old romantic in everyone .
1:apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you 'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it .

3:as played by ryan gosling , danny is a frighteningly fascinating contradiction .
2:the film did n't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due .
