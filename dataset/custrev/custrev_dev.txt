negtative:the songs do n t play one after another like on a cd
positive:awesome for the newbie  though i personally like to fasten every bolt myself
positive:this phone is a winner
positive:you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button  and it has an onscreen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus
negtative:in other words  the zen is not a convenient data storage device   only buy the capacity you need for your music collection  see point 1  for some sizing information
positive:this phone is one of the best i ve ever used
positive:if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket  take great pics and video  get the sd500
negtative:i am an it professional and have used norton for years  but this product is a complete and utter dud
negtative:one still works fine  the other quit after one day
positive:i wo n t go into the details here  as the online sites  steves digicams  previews  go into great depth in their reviews  but i am very pleased with the features  the speed  the picture quality  the flexibility  the automation  and the functional conveniences this camera offers
negtative:the software sucks
negtative:otherwise  it is difficult to figure out and awkward
positive:you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on    literally
positive:it s really a shame  because otherwise  creative mp3 players are very good  and have the best sound quality of any players on the market
positive:i like it s shape and it s keypad and joystick
positive:4  play ngage games on it
positive:the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car  is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road
positive:it is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags  easy to clean  and most important  easy to use one handed  just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle
positive:i purchased the elph s100 mainly because i thought it was cool
negtative:i also did n t like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode
positive:and also  it s priced very afford ably
positive:this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon  never knew i could love a digital camera so much
positive:it is amazingly small  it s hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera
positive:overall this is the best phone i have ever owned
negtative:the player hangs up on file transfer every onceinawhile  prompting a reset
negtative:the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod  but i have gotten use to them  and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price
positive:i also like the lock feature  so it makes the touch pad inactive
positive:very easy to use for someone like me who s just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon
positive:however after playing with it for three weeks now  i m convinced  the zen micro is superior
positive:the fm tuner  the 5g of storage  and the removable disk are all great features
negtative:the volume level of the phone is not all that good
positive:i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now  and i am very happy with it
negtative:1  frame freezes and the family yells   dad   somethings wrong with the dvd player   come quick
negtative:luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case  a finger
positive:it offers way more features than i need but the ones i use work well
positive:i finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with napster 2 go     which is a subscription service  allowing me to download as much music as i want for a 14  95 flat fee
positive:if your looking for a great sounding mini player  you can t go wrong with the zen micro
positive:autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all
negtative:as a computer  or pda its weak since the screen  while large by phone standards  is still tiny to really do anything on
negtative:no option for callerid pictures or individualized ringtones
positive:we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken
positive:the included eax support is useful at times  especially when you listen to a variety of genres  as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle
negtative:the touch sarene navigation will take a little getting used to  but once you do  and while the zen is still alive  it s a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies
positive:these issues aside  the ipod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one  you can t be without one
positive:having usb 2  0 makes for very fast transfers
negtative:all that said  i am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera
positive:plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad
negtative:the diaper genie needs it s own refill bags in order to work and that s just more money that you don t have to spend
positive:good looks
positive:the smooth operation variable speed and a set of good masada bits will provide just the right combination for great predictable results
positive:as opposed to the nomad ii or any other flash based player  the songs load extremely fast    about one or two seconds per song
positive:battery  a big big plus
positive:looks snazzy smaller than a pack of smokes  easily transported ac charger included as well as a hard shell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter usb cable
negtative:when the player was working it was great  but
positive:the greatest thing about the software  in my humble  is that it reads your cd info
negtative:3 no voice recorder  this has also become an important and popular feature that the ipod unfortunately doesn t have
positive:the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport
negtative:i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver
positive:i have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than i would have if i had purchased a single cheap reliant sharper
positive:this is the fourth version of systemworks and the second version of internet security that i have used and it has always been a favorite
negtative:whatever    on to the negatives  touchy about charging    you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it s life if you don t upgrade the firmware or dont  heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side
positive:people also have complained about the case not having a window  but that s not really a big deal to me either  the case is sturdy and offers very good protection
positive:it has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any pointandshoot we ve ever tested
negtative:second might be a problem i might have with my pc but not too sure  when the player is connected on the usb and i start playing on it and also using the windows explorer  it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronize with the pc during play  which is a bit irritating
positive:it is far better than just a trash can or the diaper genie and it s fairly inexpensive as baby products go
negtative:they have a good concept here  and i normally expect a lot better quality from creative  so maybe they will do better with the next gen version  but for now i say buyer beware
positive:but it is smooth  it is powerful  it is affordable  it has a proven track record
negtative:the only con i can think of is the lack of a megapixel camera
negtative:it it is a bit heavy for hand held work  but any router this size will be
positive:i purchased this over the ipod mini because it had several nice features  extra 1g storage  wma support  replaceable battery  and especially that it wasn t an apple product with their proprietary architecture
positive:way less expensive than the ipod
positive:i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality
positive:creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature
positive:output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv
positive:and the tech writers have made the installation process so easy for people lick my aunt to follow
positive:even though i never ventured into the cloth land  i was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life
negtative:the eq is awful  and even at top volumes  the bass is flat sounding
positive:despite the things that i have listed so far  i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work  to the gym  in the car  etc
positive:the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures
positive:extremely convenient
negtative:i m probably the only person that dislikes the itunes software
positive:but if you use all bluetooth accessories  as i do  its really not an issue
negtative:i tried to use the fm radio option  but it doesn t seem to really pick up the stations i listen  however i am going to try it in a different location  it may have just been my residential location
negtative:you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll
negtative:also the battery life isn t great but it s sufficient for my needs
negtative:all in all  not very good
positive:while it didn t have all the features i would have liked  it was better than anything else i could find at the time
negtative:if you have an older version of  internet security  installed  you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with systemworks install
positive:the software has been installed on windows 95  98  2000 and xp and i haven t had any problems with it
positive:its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it
positive:sound quality  the ipod s sound quality is pretty good
positive:if you want a sharp looking  fast digital camera and you don t need or want manual controls  then this is the camera for you
positive:the actual experience of using the ipod is magnificent
positive:i love the quality of the pictures
negtative:the cons are n t really a big deal to me    except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files    no folder structure    and it s based on the title of the songs    many of my songs where separated into folders  on the pc     and a few had same titles    so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n t have any that might be the same as another
positive:feature wise  its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there
negtative:battery life is about 14 of that advertised  no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players  on or offline   occasional software lockups  replacement battery is expensive
positive:it looks really sleek and stylish  and does everything it claims
positive:i just upgraded to the linksys wrt54g wirelessg router last month and i am very happy with the quality of the product
positive:1  the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more postprocessing flexibility
positive:4  usb 2  0 means fast data transfers  1 song  sec
positive:i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too
positive:they fix the problem and help you with whatever your ipod needs comes with two usb ports and a charger
positive:the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect
positive:possibly the biggest advantage this player has  if price was n t enough  is the fact that the user can replace the battery him  herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery
negtative:just don t get drawn into tmobile s catchy rebate
negtative:i forgot  the case does n t fit
negtative:again  this doesn t affect regular mp3 files  just subscription drmencoded files  like those from napstertogo or yahoo music unlimited
positive:i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic
negtative:have tried to contact apex via email  customerserviceapexdigital  com   but the email address is not valid
positive:very sleek  stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has
positive:very good balance in the hands and lighter than most 3 14 hp models
positive:the battery is removable
positive:the voice recorder is a beautiful addon   not even necessary  but just an example of why apple just wants your money and creative labs wants to make a better player
negtative:8mb for a camera like this is a joke
positive:the phone itself is pretty nice
positive:the software is great
positive:when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there   it is unbelievably small and oh  so light
negtative:i saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and i feel people are overexaggerating the menu load time
negtative:1  pictures wo n t transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable
positive:the soft start is nice
negtative:i would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature
negtative:for last one month my rebate status showing me that my rebate is approved and check is delivered but still i am waiting for check
negtative:it s kinda heavy  kinda like having a walkman
positive:i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards
positive:with nikon  although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras  i ve had the following headaches
negtative:it would only transfer 30 or so songs  and then come up with an error
positive:all in all  this is a great phone
negtative:the software that came with it was tough to load
positive:few month ago  it s very popular among my community
negtative:sometimes  it needs few minutes to open an application
positive:no need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require
negtative:finally  making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually  and are organized by cd  which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order
positive:it holds almost a week s worth of diapers  and you don t need expensive refills  any kitchen bags work
positive:it comes with an adapter to plug into the wall  which i hear is a step up from the other ipods  which require you plug it into a computer to charge it
negtative:like most of their solutions  which first blame other applications for errors   the tech persons line was that this was probably a microsoft error  it was not
positive:colors  10 variety of hot colors made it difficult to choose from
positive:7  some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover  has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch
negtative:first  let me say that i got the 20gb ipod for christmas  and i most likely would not have spent the 300 myself
positive:i was looking for a compact  rugged  i carry it hiking  skiing  boating  etc  camera which is easy to use
positive:but if you ve used a slr 35mm camera  the controls are very intuitive
positive:i would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something  but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router  just get the wrt54g
positive:but this does work even if you turn off the lcd viewing  great battery saver
negtative:now in october  2004  the firewall said i couldn t ok anymore software to use the internet because its full
negtative:on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd
negtative:the only main drawback is the fact that the voicedialing system is kinda picky
negtative:sure  it s a little bigger than the ipod  but not by much
positive:but  it seems to work so well now  that i do n t anticipate any problems with it
negtative:to make matters work  there is no manual override to overcome this problem
positive:for those mac osx users out there  isync works fairly well
positive:i ve been using nis 2004 for about 2 months and it works well
negtative:the only thing i don t like is the small size  8 meg  memory card that comes with it
negtative:some more manual control would have been nice
negtative:when i hooked it up it only produced sound  a cd played fine  but with a dvd i only got the audio  no picture
negtative:i tried emailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable
positive:im able to keep my phone on for about a week  mostly stand by  to three days  regular use
positive:the af feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal
positive:price and capacity
positive:your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package
positive:pros  huge storage capacity for the price  easy to navigate  can modify existing playlists on the fly  has a removable battery
negtative:the sd500 has only been in my possession for a little over 3 months  and the lcd has been broken twice
positive:5 stars all the way
positive:solid  highquality construction
negtative:first  it failed whenever connecting to get updates
positive:the power is incredible  it cut through md and plywood like butter
negtative:the movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160x120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640x480
positive:works great
negtative:2  the body construction  buttons  casing  etc  are too plastic
positive:we lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems
negtative:although i disabled norton antispam  it is still there
negtative:software  the software is crap
positive:the metal housing seems very rugged
positive:the sound is excellent  the battery life is excellent  the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent  and finally the price   200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod  is excellent
positive:the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use
negtative:the pcside software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it s not as bad as some reviewers have indicated
positive:luckily  with 3 rebates this product will cost me nothing   it is indeed worth nothing
negtative:it locked during install and i had to reformat the drive and start from scratch  greer
positive:the songs recorded with fm are as good as the original signal
positive:great phone
negtative:i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because  as other reviewers have pointed out  the construction is pretty flimsy
positive:removable and cheap battery  a li battery usually works properly for 13 years
positive:the 6600 has more amenities than most  world phone  camera  vgazoomnight modetimer   video  w audio  zoom   speaker  good sound   bluetooth  infrared  modem for computers  electronic wallet  internet access  calendar  calculator  converter and more
negtative:i also put a bend in the wrench so i can remove and install bits from the top of the table
positive:it makes the nomad i purchase feel and look like junk
positive:the possibilities with auto  manual  and the very helpful  scene  mode  which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait  landscape  beach  snow  sunset etc   are endless
negtative:i just wished that it didn t fill up so fast
positive:for the price it is a well spent investment
negtative:i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc
negtative:other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as i d like them
positive:the voice quality is very good  and it gets great reception  that is  in places where you get tmobile coverage  which is not that good   see below
positive:i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips  i give it 55 stars   oh and btw  while you take video clips  you can zoom it too    digital zoom only though     but still     my old one can t do that    you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip
positive:it s shorter  sleeker  more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the ipod    my nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy
positive:the computer interface is 90 good  only losing points due to the fact that  creative  branding is all over the place within it
positive:in fact  it supports the new wpa encryption standard  which is way better than wep
positive:aside from a 6mb builtin phone memory  there s a 32mb mmc card that goes with it
positive:in true nokia style  the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance  this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned
negtative:short warranty  3 months  so i got the extended warranty at best buy   occasional freeze up  easily fixed by popping out battery   somewhat flimsy navigation wheel
negtative:this did not feel like quality construction and i was n t sure how long it would last
negtative:as an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale
negtative:the touchpad is virtually unusable  sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don t want
positive:and bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as i thought it would  i usually can go 1  5 days with bluetooth on along with making calls before i need a full recharge
positive:a sony erickson may be the phone for you    but good luck finding one w all the features  such a competitive price
positive:good color and very little needed to correct photos on paint shop pro
positive:it has everything i needed  bluetooth  infrared  support for mmc  camera  and a good operating system with lots of supporting software
positive:zennx s replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod
positive:has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousands of songs and organizes them great
positive:i ve had it for a week now  do n t regret the purchase one bit  and i never leave home without it
negtative:we got two phones for the tmobile family plan  indeed very easy to switch to the family plan  and one came with a broken headphone  can hear but can not be heard  and one died today after less than two weeks of use
positive:the battery life is less than stellar  but it charges w the quickness
positive:the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it  jpeg  kodak pic s and dvdr  i have read other reviews and some good and so om not so good  but my feeling at this time is  two thumbs up
positive:the ipod is not overpriced compared to the market
positive:i have not yet used all the features  like the calendar  etc  but as a music player this little thing rocks
negtative:the dvd player does not work properly
negtative:1  fragile  i broke the 1st one within 10 days
positive:overall it is a great value
positive:you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right
positive:memorystorage  seemingly boundless
negtative:basically  i ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the tech help
negtative:of course one of the first things i did was write an email to the customer support at creative  through their website  and by the time they finally got back to me  several working days later when they promise only one  their suggestions were completely worthless
positive:it ll make life a lot easier  and preclude you from having to give this product a negative review
negtative:when you dial a number  you ll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct
positive:price  along with the replaceable battery  which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace  as well as the hassle of returning it  were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad
positive:at the end of the day  what i wanted was a largecapacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go  and the zen xtra s combination of price  capacity and features easily meets those criteria
positive:initially  i was very impressed  after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this  i then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright
positive:i upgraded from an older 801  11b router to the linksys wrt54g for its improved security  and of course  speed
positive:the diaper champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle
positive:a lot of people complain about the creative software  but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes
positive:overall  this product is awesome
positive:the setup was a breeze  i had some reservations about a wireless network  see my review for linksys wet11  but this item was on sale as well as the wet11 so i just had to splurge
positive:transfering mp3s are a cinch with the included software
positive:i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied
negtative:crappy headphones
negtative:i took my zen micro with me over the weekend  and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason  to keep the zen micro charged
positive:the  scene  mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a  regular  setting
positive:2 excellent picture quality and so simple to use
positive:this is my second creative labs mp3 player  and it is definitely a fine product
positive:it sure does look nice  though    i recommend this to any music lover anywhere  the quality of the audio is excellent  the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive  and the storage capacity and battery life are huge
negtative:lens visible in optical viewfinder
negtative:they obviously have quality and reliability problems
positive:mixed bag i guess but the price was right
positive:so  i was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all
positive:with the champ all you had to do was drop the dirty diaper into the opening and flip the lid
negtative:not so nice things   a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use  spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing  outside of a table   the 14  chuck sleeve requires much tightening to keep bits from slipping
negtative:they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the samesounding name  and they are long
positive:but i wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the largediameter bits
positive:the phone is small  light  and very attractive
positive:camera is a paper weight
negtative:this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared
negtative:the ad1600 did n t work correctly from the start and the ad1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up
positive:at 128 the songs sound very good
negtative:i have found too many bugs in norton internet security professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience
positive:the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone  and what a great phone it is
positive:i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd s transferred
positive:battery life keeps improving on the ipod  and a new ipod will give you up to twelve hours of play time  per charge
negtative:the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mils  real estate broker software  very well at all
positive:the interface works great
positive:just follow the instructions carefully  it s all based on a cd that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time
negtative:because steve jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an unrepeatable 18 month battery
negtative:many of our disney movies do n t play on this dvd player
negtative:i ve often struggled to get something to work the way i want it  and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time
positive:i got this camera about a month ago and i can t put it down
positive:the unit itself its well structured  with just the buttons you need and none you do n t
positive:the zen micro appears sturdy and well constructed  hefty  if you will  far better than many of its competitors
positive:i am happy with the fact that i can use any bag in there and dont  have to pay out the nose for replacements
negtative:the interface software itself  which should be userfriendly  was anything but easytouse
positive:my brother had an old linksys b band wireless router in his home and it was like magic
positive:it gives you the most bang for your buck  period
positive:second  the  automatic  sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer
positive:overall i like it
positive:the player s software is very easy to use and very good
positive:speaking of battery  it s removable and replaceable
positive:despite this minor disappointment  i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography
positive:screen was good  easy to read
positive:the handles make it very comfortable to use and i experience little vibration
positive:i fell in love with this camera  it combines ease of use  with an immense amount of options and power
positive:even though you could get a cheap router these days  i m happy i spent a little extra for the linksys
positive:plus  if you order from amazon  com  they will exchange it for you no problem
positive:the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone  unlike the nokia 3650  and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make
positive:fm tuner  microphone  having a tuner in the player is a blessing
positive:incredible memory
negtative:this is somewhat annoying  but from working with computers  especially windows  ugh
positive:overall i m incredibly impressed with my new zen touch
positive:i love this camera
negtative:after repeal cleaning and re cleaning  it still stuck after using it for a little while
positive:bottom line  this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck
negtative:i tried to play the song three times  with no success
negtative:too costly and not efficient if you ask me
negtative:i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended
positive:all in all  this product is definitely one i would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price
positive:and the firewall came with a wizard which made it effortless to configure it to my lan
positive:but  if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player  i love it
positive:overall i m happy with my toy
negtative:bluetooth does not work on this phone
positive:the nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smart phone line
positive:the volume range is great  so you can blast it if you want
negtative:the remote is flimsyfeeling and awkward to use
positive:it s great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen
positive:i use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty
positive:in short  the nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution
positive:it is light enough to carry around all day without bother
positive:7 picture quality is excellent
positive:along the way we compared it to my wife s t720i and the 6600 was superior in terms of battery life  connectivity bars and features
positive:sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweaking with settings to try to make it great
negtative:2  having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called  unknown
positive:after a lengthy and extensive journey for a featureloaded  high performance  travel size camera  i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel
positive:i was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories  desk standhard case  belt clip  wall charger  etc
negtative:unfortunately i was wrong
positive:after comparing the included creative earbuds directly against my sony mde828lp s and sennheiser mx400 s  i find myself still using the creative s  which in my opinion  sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord
positive:the first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use
positive:the prints are beautiful
negtative:i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media
positive:this router does everything that it is supposed to do  so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it
positive:compared to other leading dd mp3 players  the value per gb is the tops
positive:nothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have
negtative:b  the lens cover is surely loose  i already accidently fingerprinted the len a few times  and au lens ti gt and cause potential damage
negtative:customer service  awful  listen to this one  remember the battery statement i made earlier
positive:this is also the case with nis 2004
positive:4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome
positive:overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned
positive:the radio feature has superb sound quality
positive:m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp  but not creative  without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists    it does n t care what software you use to rip or catalog your music  creative or any other company  all my 12  5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags  hooray
negtative:so  don t buy this or upgrade
negtative:does not recognize player at random times  despite being connected and displaying player s library
positive:but for what i do use it is perfect
positive:no smell  easy to use with one hand free  and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you don t get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are impossible to find
positive:the champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year
negtative:the one i purchased for a friend as a gift will not read any dvd disc
positive:camera quality isn t bad for the low resolution
positive:there is a clock  and date  which can get helpful
negtative:the autofocus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject
positive:it fits in your pocket
positive:but i was ready to upgrade and when i discovered that canon was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher resolution  i had to have the s100
positive:it is very simple to import via photo 2 and then move them to photoshop
negtative:my file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites
negtative:the biggest problem is the installation
positive:it has a beautiful design  lots of features  very easy to use  very configurable and customizable  and the battery duration is amazing
positive:tmobile was a pretty good server
positive:large easy readable screen
positive:we are overall pleased with product
negtative:2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wideangle  wce 68  the optical viewfinder is partially obscured
positive:the software is quick  easy to use  i found the entire process very easily mastered
positive:just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking  by artist  song title  genre  etc
positive:so far the dvd works so i hope it does n t break down like the reviews i ve read
negtative:i no longer use it as a plunge router  only as a stationary or table mounted router
positive:it all sounds great too
negtative:the included earbuds were uncomfortable
negtative:also  not liking the gel case
negtative:i tried it again this morning and it said i didn t have the required  permissions  and lacked proper administrator status
positive:it uses the extend able mmc memory  it is perfect for storing videos  pictures and mp3s
positive:the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it
positive:the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality
negtative:the other day when i was listening to a song  it locked up and will not do anything now
negtative:i am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the  sliding wrench  which comes on the router
negtative:the internet connection would go down every 5 mins when i used it with a p2p program called bit spirit
positive:the screen s large and easily read
negtative:if i was pressed to find a negative aspect of the zen micro i would probably have to mention weak fm reception  but the building where i primarily use the micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway  so you can take that for what it s worth
positive:this thing plays everything i feed it
positive:it was also the most appealing
positive:very longlasting battery life
positive:turn the camera on while pressing the button  or is it the menu button   i have to check again    and it l show you the time and date
positive:the zen micro is near perfect
positive:its really cool
positive:the handsfree speakerphone is quite powerful  like the motorola phone  i used to own
positive:great camera  i have been using this for several months and got excellent results  simple friendly usage  in many scenes indoor  outdoor  snow  close up macro etc
positive:probably a great phone overall  and perhaps mine just has bugs
positive:what this plugin reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware
positive:when you learn how to change some settings  you can make the quality even better
negtative:the touch pad does take a little getting used to
positive:i m glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology
positive:a huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it
positive:unlike other reviewers  i have found the support to be responsive  almost no wait time on the phone  and relatively knowledgeable
positive:we don t have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail
positive:it also has a voice recorder and fm radio that you can only get on an ipod if you but an adapter seperately
positive:i liked this one enough to buy another
positive:this is quite simply the best you can ask for
positive:outstanding signal reception
negtative:i ve been bothered by blownout highlights on the s330  and the g3 seems to do only slightly better
positive:i downloaded a trial version of computer associates ex firewall and antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again
negtative:i m going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops i jumped through  emails  downloads  reboots  a purge and another download  plus reading through the help menu  a refund should be twice as frustrating
negtative:creative are  the  sound people for computers  i can t understand why eax would introduce static
positive:best in class sound
positive:overall i like the unit
positive:the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs  my entire collection of cd s will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun
positive:there were a few attractive features  such as the small size and the layout of the remote
positive:i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer
positive:really like it  easy to use  great images  very intuitive  fits in my jacket pocket
negtative:negtative
positive:the player is fast and sounds great  it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music  or making it sound like you re hearing the music in a huge auditorium
negtative:i sent it back  as i think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective
negtative:however  it is much bigger  bulkier  and heavier than my other router and i would not like to use it freehand  i keep it mounted in a table
positive:it fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very welldesigned  doesn t look to ostentatious while i m walking around with it
positive:it beats apple on the storage space  it beats apple on the removable battery  and batter life   and i personally like its interface more than the ipod scroll wheel
negtative:there were no other obvious setup instructions  though there was a soft copy manual  it did not give an answer readily on what do to
positive:when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra  it s that good
negtative:b  the screen is hard to read  the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display
positive:and amazon  com has it for such a great price  how can you go wrong
negtative:the cover that came with it did n t fit very well
positive:i have not been disappointed with my purchase
positive:and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey
positive:we just recently had to buy another roll of bags  so 6  00 for a year of bags can t beat that
positive:the ringtones included are awesome  and did i mention they were polyphonic
positive:i love the rounded edges now  fits so much better in a pocket  jeans or suit
positive:the g3 is loaded with many useful features  and unlike many smaller digital cameras  it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds
positive:it came with a good fence that is simple yet precise and thats well made and won t break
positive:i didnt have any installation problems   and the touch pad is fine  even if it is sort of inaccurate
negtative:for my first i had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky
negtative:when you consider expandability  downloads via computer   the numerous features  two transmission programs and multiple storage devices  dependability  this is a phone that isn t easy to outgrow
positive:for a sleeker  smaller and more  average  mp3 player the nitrus is great but the ipod blows it out of the water  the interface is great and the design is wonderful
negtative:the 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of the states and not as well in more remote areas
negtative:the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out
positive:i think the interface is great
positive:versatile and stylish
negtative:the only beef that i have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged
positive:really happy with this little camera
negtative:first of all  i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed
positive:there are no spec ail bags to deal with or buy
positive:oh    and file transfers are fast  easy
negtative:1  pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance
positive:i do not count this as a negative  however  because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up
positive:also  i am quite partial to the creative mediasource organizer and player software  which i had with audigy zs sound card originally   it is definitely an added plus
positive:it has plenty of power
negtative:video output stopped working
positive:honestly  i love this player
positive:the phone is very light weight
negtative:it is not reliable
negtative:this is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment
negtative:also  the instruction manual is very bad
negtative:every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes
positive:the hitachi is made in malaya  and looked cheap compared with the makita  which is made in the usa
positive:pick your favorite color and buy it
positive:the speakerphone  the radio  all features work perfectly
positive:so reliability is the winner here for the ipod
negtative:first  it serious  serious installation problems
positive:it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera
positive:the panorama modes are wonderful
negtative:my son tried it and he too couldn t change the speed without an assist
negtative:however  i do n t like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n t secure and the case can slip off
positive:i was more excited about this player upon opening than i was about the nomad
negtative:i tried called apex cu st service  no help
positive:even did while daughter sleep and no noise
negtative:and the remote is cheap and ch easy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck
positive:the sound is great  and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise
positive:of course  i was hesitant given the price  but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it  and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents
negtative:only then did i learn the truth  this phone does not work with palm pdas
positive:the back of the player is nice too  with water ripples inside the clear white coating
positive:3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they re still easy to use
positive:fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy  the met 60 ct4
negtative:nothing but hassle with this company
positive:when the overall image quality  especially natural colours  details  natural looking of the pictures  is the most important thing  then this camera its top notch and very impressive
negtative:another problem i had with this camera was the zoom function
positive:the battery life is very good  i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time  the first time around  and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then  and have yet needed to recharge it
positive:being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable
positive:i have never had an odor problem
positive:i love having the option to manually control the fstop  shutter speed and even focus
negtative:i was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work  to no avail
positive:this camera is so light and tiny that i literally carry it everywhere with me  which is great considering i m an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting
positive:it still fits in the palm of your hand  and it s not heavy
positive:first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good
negtative:they last about 1 12 years until the problems start
positive:i checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box
negtative:many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all i would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well
positive:as it turns out  this is an awesome camera
positive:after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative  and i have not been disappointed
negtative:as a windows user  i had to install the software including drivers and itunes on my desktop  and this is the only area where i encountered a nuisance
positive:i have tried other pails  but none have compared positively to the champ
positive:it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price
negtative:the quick sync is n t any good because it either needs to be configured properly or just is n t very useful
positive:it s the same body as the popular elp2 aps camera  take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you ll have an idea of the front profile
negtative:i assumed they had exceptional service  but their reception in my area  laos angeles  is horrendous
positive:the sound quality is excellent  and i m fussy with that stuff   the unit looks cool  screen is bright and easy to read  and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod  besides the price  but everyone knows that
positive:however  for a  600   800 budget  i think this camera is an excellent choice
positive:i received this little jewel as a gift and i can honestly say absolutely love it
negtative:the touch pad is oversensitive  and is adjustable to only slightly oversensitive
negtative:i try navigating using the player s built in menu  and it still would n t work
negtative:creative software stinks
negtative:iriver has a better fm receiver built in  but the drawback to iriver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed
negtative:unfortunately  the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone  but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming
positive:they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you don t like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the selftimer
negtative:i had the second one for less than two weeks when i noticed a rattlinghummingbuzzing sound while music was played
positive:you can use the player to store your computer data files  good feature to have
positive:the macro mode works well  although it takes some practice since the camera doesn t clearly indicate when it can t focus
negtative:of course  if you try to reach symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay 30 per incident
negtative:it played only one out of three dvd s without problems  the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches
positive:battery life is good for a phone of this size
positive:new firmware update allows for automatic wireless network configuration
positive:once installed  however  some of the functions do work ok  disk doctor  one button checkup  and win doctor
negtative:now i know why  they are pieces of junk
positive:what impressed me most was the sound
positive:it s far better than all others on the market
positive:i love this phone
negtative:not a killer problem  but not well done  either
positive:and it s the largest diaper pail i ve seen without taking up more floor space
negtative:the major reasons i didn t give it a five are  one  i didn t think the fine adjustment worked well
negtative:when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house  that one didn  t work either
positive:the screen is quite big  between all hand phone   but the just about 65000 color
negtative:this process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway
positive:the controls on the player are very simple  no need for a manual
negtative:the door would not close
positive:the macro mode is exceptional  the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject
negtative:the battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser
positive:still  at least from my perspective  a great camera for the money  and i m a happy camper
negtative:first  the cons    a tad bulky    not the most aesthetic looking player    and does n t support a folder structure
negtative:now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will
positive:easy to use  a lot of reviews has mentioned about this
negtative:we can start by losing the shiny miraclematerial cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong  and thus eliminate the need for thirdparty  asking  protective covers for an extra thirty bucks
negtative:finally  i gave up and i purchased a router racier
positive:we use the cheap 1  99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around
negtative:i m giving it 1 star because as compared to other nokia phones  its a 1  compared to other blunders by other companies  such a samsung and motorola  it might be good     but if you re getting a nokia  don t get this one
positive:but  i would definately recommend this phone
negtative:you can t change the battery  so i don t know what i m going to do in a year or so
positive:so far  the antispam feature seems to be very good
positive:smooth plunging    it did stick a bit so i sprayed it w lubricant
positive:there are lots of interesting features included such as eax  and customization
positive:this is probably one of the few dvd players at  40 that can play almost everything you throw at it
negtative:tmobile wasn t upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate
positive:i had a sony ericsson t610 before this and the t610 is far inferior
positive:6 the nikon coolpix line is a wellestablished line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model
positive:5  check traffic411  com for la traffic on the 405
positive:in a word   awesome  is how i would describe this camera
positive:i absolutely love it
negtative:the screen may be a little smaller  but it is very readable and does n t come in the overused blue
positive:silver metal case not plastic
negtative:since i received the phone  i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised tzones would work  in 24 hours
positive:the included software removes any red eye easily
positive:the radio and voice recording are nice
negtative:the dvd player just would t recognize them
positive:two  it has a removeablerechargeable battery  so you don t have to send the thing in when the re
positive:but the sound is very good  and loud  and works well on my portable speakers
positive:the functionality on this camera is mindblowing
negtative:the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occasions when i tried to do that
positive:this is a quality product  not to be confused with the cheap junk that hitachi gets manufactured in china
positive:i got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon
negtative:the zooming lever is shaky  i hope it does not operate mechanically  otherwise you ll feel uneasy
positive:the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing
positive:perhaps i bought the micro to be different  the cheaper price tag  from amazon   the design  or avoiding the high ipod theft in nyc subways
negtative:especially the bluetooth server    meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again
positive:awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package
positive:all in all it hasn t been a bad product
positive:what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvdrs fill of files  e   mp3s
positive:there s even an equalizer  under  settings   that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic  bass booster  bass reducer  classical  dance   deep   and electronic
positive:the main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients
positive:i got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon
positive:i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy
negtative:the buttons on the phone are small  even for my small fingertips  but you get used to them rather quickly
negtative:the creative zen micro is a zen micro killer  not an ipod killer
positive:the total price with delivery  free shipping  was 135
positive:i love the bluetooth   easy to use with a wireless abra headset
positive:even better  with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio
negtative:we tried the  finding memo  dvd and when we got to  chapter 28  the frames started to freeze for no reason
positive:i hooked the linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus kilobytes on the download e
positive:battery life is awesome if you upgrade the firmware requires a windows pc or make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet awesome sound quality    i mean it is creative right
positive:what i really like about its quite  it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that i can throw it away and buy another one without blinking
positive:apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment  and surprisingly wasn t as expensive as its reputation normally holds
negtative:was a bit wary because the software is windows only and i have an mac
positive:we empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it
negtative:there technical service isn t helpful either   they just read what s on their website and charge you 50   toll fees  to do it
positive:i d highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like
negtative:the only thing i do n t like about this is the cover does suck
negtative:i just uninstalled systemworks and internet security for at least the fifth time due to functionality issues
negtative:but for now it appears that this player does n t play well with itunes
positive:3  the champ is odor free for at least 15 months
positive:but at least you re starting with the most photo realistic images ive ever seen from a camera
negtative:is not as intuitive as i would like
negtative:i called apex s support number numerous times but it just kept ringing
positive:i ve had no problems with the software
positive:and it is extremely wellpriced for what you re getting
negtative:the movie clips taken will always have some  noise  in it  you can t avoid that
positive:as for itunes  i don t find it to be as good as the windows media player as a computer mp3 player  but it is good enough
positive:i like the automatic key lock function
negtative:the vibrate setting is loud
negtative:the dynamic playlists   now playing   i be live creative calls it  feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate
positive:great sound   good interface   replaceable  powerful battery   good software   wakeup  sleep timers   multiple play modes
positive:the 6610 excels as a cell phone  thank god
positive:the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative
positive:nice palm sized unit  somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you re not going to try  jog with it or something
positive:however  the battery life is good enough you should n t be overly concerned with turning this phone off
positive:the bass is deep and the treble is clear
negtative:the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera
positive:i would recommend this product to anyone
negtative:the only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust
negtative:a couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet
positive:controls easy yo use and easy to get to
negtative:i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n t a big problem
negtative:i am an advanced computer user  so i can not even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work
negtative:only problem is that is a bit heavy
negtative:1  your hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism
negtative:although  i thought it could ve been designed a bit better
negtative:the catch with the canon g3 camera   and perhaps all of digital cameras  is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots
negtative:the battery life can t be very long   let s not be greedy
negtative:the function lever  the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile
positive:supporting an operating system  symbian os  you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone
negtative:i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disappointed
positive:color screen is good
positive:it also lets you remove songs from the play order
negtative:had there been strange noises  or obvious defects  i would have accepted a replacement  but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches
positive:i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down  now buy it
positive:the base was deeper and the highs were crisper
positive:i did notice if you turn the phone on and off the os takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker
negtative:however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times
positive:the pictures are absolutely amazing  the camera captures the minutest of details
negtative:i do here a constant highpitched distorted sound  not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough
negtative:this is due to the unusually slow autofocus system
positive:this is a great phone i have this phone since feb 04 and i never have any problem at all
positive:games  not really important  but exist ant
