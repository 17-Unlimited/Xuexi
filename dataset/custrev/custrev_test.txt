negtative:its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge  not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips
negtative:the plug er gets stuck  you have to manually extract the mess
positive:it was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers
positive:i ve been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow  car  boat and wind
negtative:last  i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this
positive:powerup is quick  and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on
positive:no lockedin proprietary business like apple   this baby plays wmas too
positive:the ipod package comes with everything you need  the ac adaptor  firewire cable  quicker than usb  but slower than usb 2 which it also gives   those snazzy and power full headphones  and of course the player
positive:combine this with the excellent price we got in the gold box  and i m really happy
positive:have had the nokia 6600 for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with tmobile
positive:it s small  light and nice looking and the display is decent as well
positive:the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out  as all lithium batteries do   you will be able to buy another easily
positive:my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took
positive:it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for generalto moderate snapping
positive:speed is not a problem
positive:also  with one click you can help train your spam killer
negtative:it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full
negtative:the achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music  or copy large files over the local network
negtative:can t be left in the car    it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long
positive:this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio  but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone s radio should work perfectly
negtative:the software is somewhat nice to look at  using it is not the easiest
negtative:i see many other reviews that say the same     stay away from norton  they don t deserve you  or anyone
positive:sharper pictures
positive:the camera s a work of art  science  that s understood
negtative:this router was a huge disappointment
negtative:the only downside i have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react  meaning when i push the contacts button  it takes a while to load  this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone
negtative:the way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight
positive:the lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don t need to fuss with a lens cap
negtative:i read many reviews on norton i  s  2004 from a variety of sources  cnet  amazon  message boards  and came to the conclusion that nis 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update
positive:i ve only had this camera for a few days  but it s been great
negtative:up  down  left  and right would have given me better control
positive:which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in midi format for free on the net
negtative:3  the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture
positive:if you are looking for a userfriendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained  than the diaper champ is the one for you
positive:reset the network  tried the connection  and it s working like a charm
positive:this camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact  take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot
positive:the bags attach inside the champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle
positive:amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping
positive:3  the joystick design they are using on the new nokias gives you a great degree of control
negtative:when i purchase software  i never want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems  in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry
positive:creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean
positive:because other people that complain about this player are talking bull  this player is awesome  it just breaks fast  which is horrible
positive:1 month  no problems  great phone i m very pleased with my 6610 phone
positive:i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use
negtative:i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work
positive:with my sennheiser 497 headphones  the volume is loud enough at 12  max is 20
positive:3  user replaceable battery
positive:7  have a good chunk of my small mp3 to listen through the speaker phone
positive:both are very easy to learn  use  and intuitive enough for even a novice
negtative:it was n t as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman
negtative:a larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy
positive:i have about 6 gb used on my ipod so far  well over 1000 songs   and as far as i can tell  all of them play at nearcd quality
positive:by the way  i use the norton 2003 corporate at work with absolutely no trouble
positive:the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution
positive:this way i never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones  i can get whatever i want
positive:sure  this thing is definitely more costeffective than an ipod
negtative:still has terrible software
positive:the fm radio is cool
positive:great camera  and for the price you can t beat it
positive:we wrap them nice and tight  we use our regular kitchen trash bags  cheap
positive:with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod
negtative:so far i haven t had so much complaints except that i still haven t mastered how to scandisk when using internet security
positive:the phone can use any midi audio file as a ringtone
positive:the earbuds are great headphones as good as my ak studio 240  well not as good but darn close
positive:decent battery  on the average size  but the 40gb comes with a dock
negtative:worst feature possible  this alone makes it rate one star  what s up with no recharge cord
positive:i ve printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views
positive:it is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great
positive:the ear buds that come with it look cheap  but the sound quality is amazing
positive:i m giving this player cautious recommendation
positive:i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic
positive:over all a fantastic very compact camera  which made us experience photography on a totally new level
positive:even with that  i highly recommend this router  outstanding performer
negtative:shortly after i brought it  the plunging shafts started sticking
positive:our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality  great features  long battery life  and an unbeatable price
positive:for some this might be a problem  but for the price of a 30 gig ipod  you can get a 60gb nomad  the ipod simply pales in comparison
positive:the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me
positive:in my opinion it s the best camera for the money if you re looking for something that s easy to use  small good for travel  and provides excellent  sharp images
negtative:after installation  the very first time i booted up the creative mediasource organizer  intending to use its cd burning and ripping functions  it totally shorted out
negtative:where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable  and they included a second one free
positive:other than that  the simian series 60 os is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you re willing to hunt for it
positive:the other controls are all very easy to use
positive:small size
positive:reliability  build i dropped the player once from about 4 ft  and it fell hard  but kept on playing
positive:i love how small the thing is  and the blue glow  i ve had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all
positive:overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable  robust  and useful little camera
positive:sound quality is great  fm tuner is fine  as is the recorder
negtative:2 it is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use
positive:long live apple  long live macs  and long live the ipod
positive:works great
positive:i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks  and the ease of use is wonderful
positive:and the phone has a very cool feature which allows you to send images via a normal pop3smtp email account
negtative:but after 10 days  the sound worked  but the video quit working
positive:the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use
positive:this model appears to be especially good
positive:the system is terrific in size and design  imo looking better than the ipods
positive:great colors  pictures and white balance
positive:as far as user interface is concerned  the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player  creative mediasource organizer
positive:newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box
negtative:got a  system error  problem 30 days after purchase
positive:there is also a small covering for the lens  so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched
positive:working for 10 hours with it on  shuffle  totally rocks
negtative:i had some issues when i had enabled wep encryption and then moved on to wpa
positive:i have a canon a 70  and now this sd500  its amazing  how this little camera produces  such great pics  it even brings out ur pimples on the face
positive:sorts music by artist  album  genre  etc    it s easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you re looking for
negtative:so  right out of the box i had issue
positive:i ve had almost no problems with the firmware  ie  lockups  shutdowns etc   but i have kept the player up to date
positive:the photo quality is amazing
negtative:if the plunging action is critical to your work  look elsewhere
negtative:to install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called symantec or nortron     also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted
negtative:it had issues right off the bat  with freezing up  staying in shutting down  mode  and just not functioning very well in general
positive:the camera is adequate and if i want highres photos i ll use my digital camera instead
negtative:unfortunately  this digital momentcapturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted
negtative:finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600
positive:i think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good
negtative:the touchpad is annoying sometimes  give me the clickwheel and pres sable buttons any day   but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying
positive:first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better
positive:i love all of the features  and presets as well
negtative:you can t do that with a sony t610  which i traded for a 6600
positive:installation was as near automatic as can be
positive:yes  the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range
positive:price
positive:the setup and transfer process was cake for me
positive:you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call
positive:try before you buy if at all possible  although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod  the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface
negtative:it ain t cutting edge  no pun intended  state of the art with all the latest bells  whistles  it definitely ain t pretty
positive:i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase
positive:i am very pleased with my purchase
positive:as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine
positive:the wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog
negtative:2  despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality  i experienced a flaw using eax
negtative:finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels  first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks  flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store  which  if you ever plan to pay for your music  is by far the best
positive:i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a firstclass digital camera at a reasonable price  there is no better camera out there  period
positive:the included leather pouch is a big plus  it actually protects the unit well  something a lot of  carrying cases  fail to do with other audio devices
negtative:linksys is more costlier than others and is a homeconsumer division of disco
positive:since batteries do run out on everything  this will also be a big moneysaver since ipods  rivers  rca  dell  all have builtin batteries that need to be replaced by a technician  apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement
negtative:one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia  so standard headphones will not work
positive:i bought the diaper champ and have been very happy for the following reasons
positive:lots of sound options  has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options
positive:the appearance is okay ed  at least not ugly
negtative:however  it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my dix rips
negtative:this is extremely lame
positive:all i have to say is that the pics i get with my sd500 are both rich and color and high in detail  the user interface is awesome  the battery charger is tiny and super light and sd cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time
positive:removable battery
positive:it s a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in europe are quite reasonable
negtative:also  the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable  although my wife didn t have a problem   so i bought a pair of overtheear headphones
positive:this one has a good looking
positive:i have stored around 60 cd s  at 160kbps  on this and have barely touched the available memory
negtative:if you hold down the scroll wheel too long  which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through   it will get  stuck  rapidly going through the songs and wo n t stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it
positive:well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player  at that size and the price
negtative:that s when it went from oder less  to odorous
positive:we tried it out christmas night and it worked great
positive:the controls are on the side instead of on the front  which i like  because that s where my thumb is when i hold the thing
positive:i ve now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it
positive:they take excellent macro shots as well
negtative:who knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will
positive:best of all the wmas  i have a lot of them  sound great
negtative:4  no fm or voice recording  these would have been nice extras
positive:whichever it may be  i m happy i ve made this purchase
negtative:the little bag it comes with is cheap and useless
negtative:hard drive screws up occasionally
positive:this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used
negtative:finally  after about a week s use  the screen started to freeze on me
positive:i use the same storebrand tall kitchen trash bags i already use in the kitchen for it  no special  diaper  trash bags necessary
positive:it has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight
negtative:the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance
negtative:also  when i dial an  800  number like an airline  it will not allow me to use number keys to navigate the prerecorded menu
positive:has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range
negtative:the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless
positive:all of the wireless components that i bought were a breeze to set up as well
positive:but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything
positive:get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings
positive:range of functions  as indicated above  it has something for everyone  point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography
positive:it has a handsfree loudspeaker  conference and transfer
negtative:f  it doesnt look pretty  spending this kind of cash  you want something that has the aesthetics bit down  of course
negtative:some dvd s i rented would not play
positive:the 6600  tmobile  is the true world phone  in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe  including new zealand and australia  900  whereas the 6620  available from singular  replaces it w 800mhz  some refer to as 850
negtative:unfortunately  after loading 280  songs  all i get now is  player either not connected or busy
positive:the headphone earbuds are average  so just use your regular pair instead
positive:neat feature for selftimer allows you to record two different warnings
positive:one  it s size  it s smaller than the ipod mini  and holds more music  5gb to the ipod mini s 4gbs
negtative:creative labs customer support website is useless
negtative:after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem
negtative:only owned it about two weeks so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon
positive:using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient
positive:the hitachi has plenty of power  runs smooth  and cuts effortlessly through maple  with freud bits
positive:and with usb 2  0  transferring music to your player is incredibly easy
positive:the log functions helps you track down the incoming  outgoing calls in the most easy of ways
positive:i found best results in most situation with manualcenter auto focus  manual mode  iso 100  shorter aperturetime  so more often sharper images as with iso 50   auto white balance  auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras i have and they already do verywell
negtative:i was having intermittent problems with it losing connection
positive:best electronic i ve bought since i was born
positive:i treat the battery well and it has lasted
positive:the camera is as easy to use as a point and shoot  and with instant review on the lcd screen  you can retake any flubbed shots on the spot
negtative:the viewfinder does not accurately represent the picture being taken
positive:i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder
negtative:just the home version of norton internetav has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with
negtative:so now it still plays everything  you just can t see it
negtative:once it froze so bad i couldn t even use the power button to turn it off  and had to open and take out the battery
negtative:software definitely sucks  hangs up my notebook about half the time  but i do n t mind buying notmad
positive:photos are pretty darned good
positive:it is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth precisely
positive:all in all  this is a wonderful device
positive:not only is it much more cost effective  you can use regular trash bags rather than refills at 5 a pop   it is easier to use and clean  and has a larger capacity
positive:i use it in the table  never take the springs out  just attach the fine adjustment knob   in my woo drat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances
positive:as said before this works perfectly
negtative:3  the case hides the display  you have to open it to see what you are doing
negtative:dont rely on tmobile rebates
positive:mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download
negtative:the video recorders a bit odd  sometimes i get 9 secs on my recordings  sometimes i get 17
negtative:canon s g3 does it consistently
positive:here s the brief synopsis  the phone is tiny  cute  feels kind of  plasticlike   as if it might break   but seems pretty sturdy
positive:the price is incredible with the bonus pack and hitachi s 25 incentive  you need the code  go to tool seeker  com and it tells you
positive:great reception  visibility and interface  may be complicated by others
positive:the small size is perfect for my little hands  but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person
positive:there is an alarm  i still havent used it yet  but it should be good
negtative:rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area  the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made
negtative:this is not a router i would suggest for a novice user  my old dlink di52
positive:ability to play most discs  i tried dvd  vcd  dvdr  audio cd and it played all
positive:the supplied headphones are handsdown better than the mediocre ipod buds
positive:there are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact
positive:the color screen makes this freeafterrebates phone shine bright  and commands are very responsive
positive:positive
positive:holds the odor in nicely
positive:goes 3 days after a charge
negtative:it was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers
positive:as often mentioned  the scroll tab is average  however  not difficult to use or horrible
positive:the diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into  what diaper smell  in less time than that
positive:smaller size  1 gb of more space  radio  voice recording  removable battery  cooler look  all in one
positive:bottom line    great product  unbeatable price
positive:this is one of the best purchases we made
positive:overall the ipod really is an almost flawless beast  the capacity in the 20 gb is more than i think most people would ever need and  for the price  i highly recommend it
positive:yin to point out they have experience  and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best
positive:the player looked good right out of the box  offering lots of features and good styling
positive:i downloaded and updated the firmware  and followed the easy setup instructions
positive:navigating through the menus is super easy  especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone
positive:diaper champ is great
positive:the sound from the player is ok
positive:excellent sound quality
positive:my sd500 focuses flawlessly  does not  whine  during video  and my pictures are razor sharp
positive:this camera also has a great feel and weight to it
negtative:this is ridiculous
positive:for the price i don t think you can beat it
negtative:i ve sent 10 emails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response
negtative:it would spin  read  spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc
positive:the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy  and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player  so it wo n t take up space on your pc hard drive
negtative:this product is too fragile for normal use
negtative:t610 supports only midi files
positive:easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot
positive:i don t have problems with the depth adjustment  the speed control  the collet  i haven t tried the 14  sleeve yet
negtative:because of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product
positive:i m not one who uses web browsing  so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs
negtative:downside  it takes a long time to start up
negtative:even after all the nightmare sound problems  i d still halfway like this product if it kept it s promise   the ability to store 1500 songs
negtative:it seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the micro to pull in a strong sound
negtative:2  scroll button  switch
negtative:there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open  my perv  machine did it automatically   and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance
negtative:the entire unit was poorly crafted
positive:looks sleek  compact  has a radio
negtative:3 it is slow  if you keep the original configuration and prigs  why d u buy it then      it ll run smoothly  but still slower than most other colouredscreen nokias
negtative:p  s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error
positive:as far as linksys goes  i have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well  no problems
positive:they look fantastic
negtative:i finally got a free support number for norton through my usp support staff  but waited an hour or more for a voice
negtative:3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate  but not very robust
negtative:well  within 45 days the video output quit working  both rca  optic
negtative:however  symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release
negtative:symantec should give us all a refund and apology
negtative:the tech support is worthless too
negtative:while light  it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets
negtative:the menu options appear one at a time  taking up the whole screen  and one has to scroll down one by one  or have memorized where they are in the menu order  to select them by using the number keypad
negtative:in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the sidemounted volume control
negtative:cons breaks easily
negtative:you have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost
positive:the more i use it and figure out how to do things  the more i like it
negtative:second  the menu system and controls are poorly designed
negtative:i ve had nokia s for years  and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use  a phone
negtative:one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder  but does not detract from the image at all
negtative:about 10  of the time it can t find the device when i attach it to my pc
negtative:the only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full
positive:i will never use all the  whistles and bells  this machine is capable of
positive:i got a 1gb mmc upgrade for this phone and now i can
negtative:the build quality shows why its so cheap  small scratches on the base plate  something that you would n t see on a sony and an overall plastic feel
positive:if you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty  this is the player to get   highly recommended
positive:received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector
positive:most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy
positive:i find it pretty easy to use    and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx  on the pc
positive:you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of  now playing  interface  you can see the interface as modern or classical
positive:saw the hitachi on amazon  com with their 25  00 coupon  at the time  and could not resist trying it out
negtative:pc cable is too expensive     50 for a usb cable
negtative:now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk
positive:i have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before i drop money on a tool and everyone i talked to loved this router
positive:i did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here
positive:although the supplied software can be annoying at times  on whole it is excellent
negtative:poor visibility on the keys
negtative:since zen does not have an external antenna it has some problems catching weak signals but it works
positive:i imagine if i left my player untouched  no backlight  it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level
positive:the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable
negtative:there is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedious activation process  and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive
negtative:it is buggy  slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user
negtative:1  a spare battery would have been great
negtative:at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well
negtative:unfortunately  i sold it exactly a month later
positive:also love waking up to music with attached speakers
negtative:wo n t play a lot of discs
positive:slowsyncro flash  macroinfinity mode  etc
positive:i still have over 19gb left  and already have over 200 cd s on it
negtative:the touchpad would be a great thing if it worked well  and as i never had issues getting songs transferred to the player  i did have problems accessing them from the player
positive:i must have gotten a good one
positive:it works well enough  so far  for me to be satisfied with it  and it s possible that i m missing something
positive:light  compact design
positive:but this by far is the best phone out there right now
positive:i don t know if we ll run into trouble down the road with odors  but so far i have no complaints and i m very happy not to have to buy those refills
negtative:they didn t know what the problem could be
negtative:i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with  bass boost
positive:the camera has a wonderful set of features
negtative:in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class
negtative:third  the poor design continues with the case
positive:i do like this phone overall  would give it a 3  5   but unfortunately  i am returning it
positive:this camera takes amazing pictures and its size can not be beat
negtative:1a cell phone is to make calls  in other words  quality of reception and micspeaker are the most important  the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker  you d have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying  unless the surroundings were completely quiet
positive:the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair s  notmad  software because of some advanced features i wanted
negtative:it constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like walls in our house block the link so everything is very slow
positive:the setup was very easy
positive:i own this phone for about 6 months now  i have used the following features  bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with outlook  transfer files  movies  songs   i have many movies on it now with a 512mb memory card that it takes
positive:songs transfer lightning fast  and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time
positive:i love this camera
negtative:after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment  for myself and for my parents  for whom it was a gift
positive:the arm band is fantastic and it doesn t budge even at the gym
positive:the program is called nomad and works great for me and seems to cover all the features the included windows software does
positive:since then  i have not found one major problem with it
positive:when it came down to it  the price on this player is hard to beat
positive:i also tend to like the sliding coveron switch found on many compact ps cameras since it s much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot
negtative:the only problem is the size of the keys
positive:if you re looking for a small  compact  super resolution digital camera  you can end your search with the nikon 4300
positive:the sound is bright and clear  the ability to store any mp3 s  and not just appleapproved files  is great  and i plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time
negtative:and the case  how did this ever make it out of quality control
negtative:the only problem i had was a small glitch with tmobile
positive:he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them
positive:i discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure  white balance  flash  red eye  person against bright background  flash on  flash off  flash automatic
positive:hold button  suprisingly not all mp3s have this   this allows you to have all the buttons unusable  so that you don t accidently hit something in your pocket
negtative:i tried to do this by instinct and it s not intuitive unless you are a network geek
positive:the unit is easy to use and intuitive
positive:despite a critical start  this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do  which is pretty lofty     does more than most    does it well    is dependable
positive:also included in the  games  section is the great music trivia option  which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs
negtative:weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso   it does n t show the complete file names of mp3s with really long names   you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc   before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly
positive:by the way  it looks nice also
negtative:my old siemens s56  on the other hand  worked beautifully with all of the above
positive:it works better and has more useful features than nis 2003
positive:has a great helpline
positive:excellent phone  the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures
positive:the sound quality is excellent  except  maybe a  tad  too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line
positive:love the speaker phone
positive:moving on to sound department    it delivers
positive:the micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface
negtative:no memory stick slots  although a rare feature  it would be nice to have extra storage  not that it needs it builtin lithium battery  a huge hassle to bring this back   draining the battery once you get it helps  but removablereplaceable ones are a lot more convenient
positive:the tiny  postagestamp sized  remote unit is wonderful  not only does it trigger the shutter  it can also be used to zoom and review pictures
positive:you won t need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks
negtative:each of the 4 lasted less than six months
negtative:you need the software to actually transfer files
negtative:his is what i get for my 200 on this mp3 player
negtative:maybe it is my lack of experience  but i found shots with this camera very disappointing
positive:we just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are scented and they are like 6  00 and they work great
positive:2  the champ uses regular store bags
positive:with bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long
negtative:to eliminate any smells we simple stuck a stick up room deodorizer inside the lid
negtative:mine was so bad i had to to use a hammer to free it  and this is why i m giving it 4  not 5 stars
positive:both the onoff switch  soft start  and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand
positive:it really is the perfect travel camera  plus it offers the convenience of digital photography
positive:am i ever glad that i decided on this camera
positive:the battery life is ok  but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on
negtative:the photos in the address book are terribly scaled too   they look as though they were built out of legos
negtative:it was a symantec error
negtative:the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly  dangerous when you re driving at night   and there s no way to change this
negtative:it was immediately noticeable that nis slows down my computer  pent4  256 ram
negtative:i give it 4stars only because the installation process  or rather problems that may surface during the installation process  can be frustrating to the average computer user
negtative:only con i can think of is no camera
negtative:can t say whether i rec d an  updated  model but it will not read dvd  rw s or vcd s for me
positive:so  why the small digital elph  rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality   size2
negtative:this camera uses a lithium battery  i find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient   because what if you are on vacation  where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station  there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there
negtative:i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks  when tzones never worked
positive:there are extra features packed inside this unit  some that most will hardly ever use  such as fm radio tuner  voice recorder  calendar  and alarm clock
negtative:however  my hard drive did fail  and i have not dropped it once
positive:there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone  it is a great phone  mine worked without any problems right out of the box
positive:it s still one of the smallest 2mp digital cameras on the market  and absolutely one of the bestbuilt most stylish cameras ever
positive:apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players
negtative:norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products  but with this one  they have fallen off the cliff
positive:this product is a lifesaver
positive:so far the software for the pc works easily
positive:the range is terrific  i am using this for my home and i was transferring at 50mbs from my backyard
positive:i rarely get drawn in by masscommercialism  but something about the ipod made me say  in the words of lou and andy   i want that one    i was willing to shell out
positive:for the price  it s a very nice dvd player
positive:pros the design is very nice  and the colors are too
positive:all in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment
negtative:can t get easier than that
positive:this thing seriously is a good player though
positive:finding a particular song  s  or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy
negtative:granted  i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas  but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player
negtative:i then tried to set up the router through linksys s browser interface  but as the only instructions available tell you to use the installation cd  i had little luck  i did manage to connect briefly  but the connection kept dropping  and with no idea of how to resolve that issue  i gave up
negtative:i only have one complaint  and that is the 8mb card included
negtative:it takes a while to learn how to use it right  and at this point i am able to make about 70 of my calls using it
positive:the accessories that come with the player are great
negtative:even when i set it to low  it s still very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what i want it to do
negtative:it wo n t play 80  of my movies  which are all store bough ten
negtative:the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out
positive:i click pictures in jog format and because the phone has a bluetooth device i find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth
positive:this thing is great  i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my counter top and also to listen to my old 8track records
negtative:there is no way you can talk with customer care about this
negtative:my fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones
negtative:now the bad  1  as usual  battery power not sufficient for daily usu age
positive:so for the money it costs for one of those topoftheline models i ve got a good router  a nice table to put it in  i like that
negtative:there are some highs to the 2004 edition  but mostly lows
positive:first of all  the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos  sound clips  photos  texts  etc
positive:1  the diaper champ doesn t require special refills that are expensive and hard to find
positive:without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen
positive:additionally  it has more fun stuff like more tones  wallpapers  screen saver  stop clock  alarm  java applications  chess  currency converter etc
positive:i ve only had it a week  but so far  everything about this camera is making me happy
positive:i ve had it for about 2 weeks and it s the best player i ve seen  and used  ever
positive:3  joy stick for eazy navigation  35mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff
negtative:e  the case is too small  it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage
negtative:minor complaints  1  even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player  the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable
positive:i would however highly recommend the m12v router
positive:i installed  activated and registered nis 2004 without issue
positive:no one has ever come to my house and noticed diaper odor
positive:nokia was my first non flip phone  and i m glad i decided to go with them
positive:fortunately for me  i have yet to have a single problem with this player
negtative:my  fast forward  button works  but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go
positive:the phone offers a 32 mb mmc card and i think that is certainly the most exciting feature
negtative:it is hot enough to be annoying
positive:it was easy to assemble  and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion
positive:fact is  it could n t be easier to use
negtative:the only problem i had was a few components didn t quite load correctly upon startup  but a reboot fixed the problem
positive:perhaps semantic could work out the efficiency a little  but these reviews are highly exaggerated    i would ask what else these people are running on their computers
negtative:there is no photo viewing option  however  there is a 20 gb photo ipod  but it costs 20 more
negtative:my main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn t even fit a smaller sized garbage bag
positive:the battery recharges raul fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice
negtative:however  the creative software is not real intuitive
positive:it contains the smell from our baby s diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside
positive:it feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon
positive:the photo quality is amazing and i know i m going to have fun with all the features
negtative:the only knock i have is that the flash is underpowered
negtative:the scroll bar is a bit of a pain
negtative:i ve tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered
positive:i ve had nothing but good luck with tmobile
positive:this product is way cooler than anything ive used before  pencilings and maccabees and norton antivirus alone
negtative:even the  shorter  battery life  though  has not impaired my positive experience with the zen micro in any way
positive:there are number of downloads neededavailable for this phone  they will be text ed to you at no cost
positive:if i had to do it over again  even with the cost savings of using any type of bag  i would go w the diaper genie
positive:the camera was a marvel
positive:i got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags
positive:this player is fantastic in terms of audio quality  ease of use  and features
negtative:i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for
negtative:only slight negatives i ve had so far is that i haven t been able to get it to accept any of my wav files yet
positive:this is really a no brain er
positive:the 6600 was the best phone i could find with these options that i could get with tmobile
negtative:when i finally got it working  it only worked properly for many a month
negtative:update  january 27th 2004  the second one crapped out only after a week  dont buy this product
positive:bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago  and so far it has been excellent
positive:i did not conduct a rigorous test  but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras  and the canon won hands down
negtative:both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best
positive:it can not be the computer or the owner  since i purchased mcgee antivirus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems
positive:this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature  to find out more just log on to canon s website
positive:the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had
positive:it s light weight enough to take with you everywhere  but powerful enough to get outstanding pix
positive:after getting one for christmas from amazon  i m now a believer  the digital elph is truly the world s smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures
positive:i like this router a whole lot better the linksys 11b router it replaced  the signal strength seems ot be much strainers  seldom falling below the  very good  range  and most often excellent within 2550 feet of the router
positive:the guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid
positive:it practically plays almost everything you give it
positive:the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i ve seen
positive:if you use linux and want gr ps andor want to use a handsfree bluetooth device  and want a decent camera  this is the phone for you
positive:the software was great  as long as you have an administrative user account  windows xp
positive:it s a highly rated  kick ass firewall program that s bundled with the venerable norton antivirus  plus extras  like norton antispam  norton parental control  that make this security suite a musthave for people who have broadband internet access
positive:perfect size   beats the competition by leaps and bounds
negtative:this was an awesome player  before the video output no longer worked  after about 3 weeks
negtative:if it weren t so big i would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers
positive:get it  it s woth every penny
negtative:the only thing i m concerned about is the quality  longevity of the buttons on the thing
negtative:will never purchase apex again
positive:very small
positive:you just can t go wrong with this one
negtative:a  feel cheap  the plastic is feels like it would break very easily  and it definately wouldnt survive a drop
negtative:you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best
positive:broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies
positive:i just went on a quick photo shoot in nyc s central park today  and what a bunch of beautiful photos i took  if i do say so myself  and i do
positive:the player looks so much better when you re actually holding it
positive:i ve tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of skate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great
positive:i think their antivirus software was one of  if not the best  on the
positive:the player looks great  feels great  and sounds great
negtative:2  the scroll button is n t the best  as it sometimes can be hard to select
negtative:but be prepared to buy something else  diaper genie    which can trap the odor better
positive:having done all this  i was quite pleased to see that all corners i needed were decently covered by the signal
negtative:the battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use
positive:fm transmitter  belkin has a good one  to use zen with your car stereo fm tuner latest find  connected this baby to my 3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to ipod
positive:a call to customer support  got to a live person within a couple of minutes  helped me tweak a couple of the settings to streamline performance
positive:battery life is good  although i recommend two rechargeable  or a alkaline backup  for those emergency pics you have to have
negtative:but when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture
positive:the size is small  just a little bit bigger than an ipod
positive:the battery life seems good  takes very little time to charge  it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs
positive:the service from tmobile is very good too
negtative:if you want to purchase a real case or container or clipon carrier for you zen micro  expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time
negtative:the volume
negtative:the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case
negtative:the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected
positive:the whiteled backlit lcd is very bright and crisp  even in sunlight  and relatively easy on the battery
positive:i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode
negtative:i think it is a combination of the program size taking up resources and the openclose scanning that it does with every program
positive:you can turn this phone into a gaming machine  a camcorder or a digital camera  an mp3player  a movie viewer  a voice recorder  a personal secretary  a gaps map browser  a book  a multifunction remote controller  practically everything that you can do with the computer  plus it is a phone       and also you can carry it in your pocket
negtative:but this is  not documented  in the zen manual  neither the hard copy nor the cd version
positive:the plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing
positive:by focusing exclusively on quality rather than excessive marketing  they have introduced a player that can look the ipod straight in the eye and not flinch
negtative:only downside is when taking pictures in lowlight conditions without the flash
positive:compatibility with other devices is excellent too   i ve only found one 11b device that won t work with its mixed mode  and it won t work with anyone s mixed mode
negtative:a little weighty  9 ounces    no biggie   but otherwise fine
negtative:i hope it s because it s new and they are not out yet  but being without a remote is hard
negtative:the only thing i don t like about it is that you have to buy a larger memory card  first thing
positive:seriously   i love it
positive:they re pretty comfortable  stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality
positive:12  big storage  my entire cd collection in one small device  5717 songs  491 albums and counting
positive:to keep it short  this is cheaper  and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod
positive:the picture is perfect  although i m not watching on an hdtv
negtative:yes  you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle  but then it is gone
positive:my experience with installation was quite good
negtative:lens cap is a really annoying
positive:so far it has been very durable  other than the little pads on the earbuds   but those aren t really necessary as i find them comfortable on their own
positive:regardless to this fact  i believe the champ is the best way to go
positive:it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly
negtative:so  i ve had it for a month  and the headphone jack went out
positive:sound quality is wonderful  i really like the smart volume sound normalization
positive:oh  and another is the cool  halo  light that surrounds the touch pad  and light s up when you touch the screen  and how the light glows when the zen is connected to the computer
positive:if i could  i d tradeup on my creative muvo2 and snag a zen micro tomorrow
positive:with the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn  it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones
positive:lastly  the price is fantastic
negtative:the only reason for not giving it 5 stars  the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic  possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player  but in real life i can probably get 68 hours at most
positive:the voice recorders good  but you can t record songs off the radio for ring tones
negtative:for example  in auto mode you can t use the flash redeye reduction  you must be in manual mode for that
negtative:we found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader  there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used
positive:finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me
positive:you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy
negtative:the downside being that the tito can only connect at 802  11b speeds and not 802  11g
negtative:some adjustments in the settings could help make it better
negtative:the only disappointment so far has been battery life
positive:what makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has
negtative:it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want
negtative:there will be much erasing of text as  one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters
negtative:it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time
positive:have used it frequently and have had no problems
negtative:regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop
negtative:do not buy any home version of norton anything
negtative:the only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment
positive:6 small but very clear tft screen
positive:i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures
positive:but it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2  1 mp camera
positive:i ll be getting a second one for my router table
negtative:navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well
negtative:it seems like the software is just not responding
positive:great design  very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied  virtual ones are the only competition    and now the wheel clicks  taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus
positive:best in class
positive:comes with a installation cd which instructs you step by step to setting up the router
negtative:i have to move pictures off of it every day so i have room for more pictures the next  and i don t have enough money to buy the 256 meg card that i ve had my eye on for a while
negtative:some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear  but not easy to listen to
positive:the battery life on this phone is surreal
positive:one cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem
positive:there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things
positive:i have come across many other beginner cameras that i prefer over this camera  but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size
negtative:with the plunge lift all my bit changing has been done above the table  although i still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock  and  of course  the speed and onoff controls
positive:the features are really cool like the radio
positive:settings for just about everything  beautiful pics and beautiful prints
negtative:there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient
negtative:this dvd play is basically junk
positive:everything shines of quality
positive:the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s
positive:i did n t read a thing about how to operate it  it was just intuitive
negtative:1  player is not plug and play  need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it
positive:the   sound quality is great
positive:the sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn t be easier to use
positive:unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition
negtative:the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n t have to reboot the computer or anything  just open up explorer again
negtative:the karma doesn t look as sexy but it s interface is very efficiently designed
negtative:too bad they don t mention anything about how the cd can t be used with a mac
negtative:2  it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow
positive:it s good
positive:seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise
negtative:only thing missing from creative is a cd burner
positive:the storage capacity is great
negtative:the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the imageaffecting settings in the camera
negtative:same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex  nothing
positive:without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image
negtative:the scroll wheel  to be blunt  sucks
positive:it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into
positive:the great and versatile ipod
positive:and also  since it is teri band and since it uses simcard  you can just use it in europe and many other parts of the world  wherever gsm exists
positive:ok  not quite everything    but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it
positive:i have it for a week now  and this camera has exceeded my expectations
positive:i purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the ct people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed
negtative:if you buying this player to use with napster to go  wait a while
positive:go for the champ
negtative:2  not very ergonomically  you ll find even for a pointandshoot lens
positive:the startup time  quality of pictures and videos is outstanding
positive:the stand that comes with it is very useful to prop it up on the desk
negtative:the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the lcd most of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me
negtative:its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket
positive:all in all this a great player that blows the ipod away  with easy to use and understand features  software that is simple to understand and use  and a great sound  which is all that matters in a mp3 player
positive:no matter the format
negtative:the zen does n t support folders so it is not really a storage device   even with third party software that  creates  folders  documents and programs can t be launched from the zen  so it is not a hard disk  it s a storage device at best
positive:this thing does everything but washes your dishes
positive:their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific
positive:at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support
positive:i enjoy getting use to the touch pad
positive:a decent piece of hardware with great speed  i get the same speeds as with my comp connected directly to the modem  and good signal quality
positive:i use it on a router table  and it is works well
positive:the product has worked perfectly for me on my xp
positive:the transmission speed is also quite good  with pages loading very quickly
positive:the speed control is well designed and it works perfectly
positive:track   name  artist  album and genre is automaticallyretrieved via internetlabeled  and properly categorized into the zen
positive:it s a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up
negtative:1  the included lens cap is very loose on the camera
positive:it s really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch
positive:while this phone obviously doesn t have the same quality construction as motorola does  the nokia 6600 is one of the better phones i ve used
negtative:i would have liked to have given it 4 12 stars docking that 12 star only for the size
negtative:my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags  that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n t have them
positive:but it   you won t regret it
positive:the zen offered a great alternative
negtative:and supply those stupid white headphones
negtative:it is made of plastic
positive:the more i work with it  the more i love it
negtative:the menu options are uncreative  as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from   you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for  yes  this is minor  but not when you re trying to keep your eye on the road
positive:especially for the price amazon gives it at  i was unable to get mine through amazon due to some credit complications
negtative:as a loyal customer of nortonsymantec products  i purchased internet security 2004 as a software firewall and could not be any more dissatisfied with the product  and hence the one star rating
positive:i purchased this phone for just 50  and there is no end to what i can do with it
negtative:although i find it more convenient to use 1touch dialing  this phone does not have voice dialing
negtative:unfortunately  the player would not read any of my region one dvds  even though they were not damaged in any way
negtative:the scroll button is overly sensitive at times   not sensitive enough at others
positive:no need for deodorizers
positive:the buttons and interface are very easy to use
negtative:when we tried to hook up the first one  it was broken  the motor would not eject discs or close the door
positive:10 great price for all the features
positive:the sound quality is excellent  accessing the music is easy  and the controls are generally well thought out
positive:i have not played with all the features yet  but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it
positive:this is my first mp3 player and i am so impressed with what such a small device can do
positive:4  the shape of this device is a little squarer  without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking
positive:fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket
positive:nokia makes great phones  and this one is the cream of the crop
negtative:enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n t work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem
positive:especially the lcd is big and the camera quality is among the very best around
negtative:i thought this camera was awful and i did tons of research on cnet and other sites
positive:the quality is superb
negtative:forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds
positive:usb 2  0  very fast
positive:the battery lasts very long when playing music  but writing files to the player drains the battery fast  so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files
positive:the click wheel is incredibly convenient  however it can be a little overly touchy at times  which will make you frustrated with your own fingers
negtative:i tried to contact apex to return it  i missed the amazon return period  and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept
positive:as i drove across the country i lost reception only in eastern kentucky s mountains
positive:4mp  4x optical zoom  takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras  easy to understand and use  has a great swivel lcd screen   a lot of features and addon options  comes with great software  not to be overlooked   and last but by far not least  received my fiance s stamp of approval  two thumbs up
negtative:the headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use  and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony s i d been having
positive:comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit  included  is fast and small
positive:the view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer
positive:i upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my sony vaio laptop  xp operating system
positive:i have had no problem whatsoever with this product
positive:other than this  i am very pleased with the router and would buy it again
negtative:the creative mediasource software that comes with the zen micro is cluttered  and excludes my favorite feature in itunes  the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder
positive:i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category
positive:i actually took a friends word on it and went with this champ when registering and i am glad i did
negtative:software downloads on the site crashed my pc
negtative:one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low
positive:in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click  the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results
positive:even leaving it on the default setting  without the eax enhancements  produces crystal clear playback
positive:so sit back  relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can  and for a fraction of the price
negtative:my only complaint and the reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the oncamera controls aren t as intuitive as they should be
positive:it is mindless to operate
positive:although canon s batteries are proprietary  they last a really long time  recharge fairly quickly in the camera  plus if you want  more power   you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon
positive:best camera ever  from the image quality  color  function  i can say almost everything
negtative:you have to wonder why creative can t get this right
negtative:i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again
positive:i haven t tried to set up any advanced features on the router  but it is not difficult to set up for basic use
positive:my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature
negtative:i must say  this one is quite slow to open an application
positive:overall it is a great unit  hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it
negtative:we also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped
positive:in fact  i liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old  that i bought one for our new baby s room
positive:also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and br mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these
positive:1 speakers at home  i rarely use it with the earbuds  though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players
positive:best phone i ve ever owned  period
positive:hitachi s m12v is a big beast of a router
negtative:the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to
negtative:the phone has a few minor inconveniences  but only because it lacks those features  bluetooth and high spend internet  but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do
negtative:though nearly a dozen different people at both tmobile and nokia have told me otherwise  it is simply not possible to use this phone as a bluetooth modem for the vast majority of pdas and many other devices
positive:i never had a single problem
negtative:2  the remote works  but then it does not work  and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong
positive:ripping your songs and creating playlists could n t be any easier
positive:i highly recommend this phone
positive:i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer
positive:when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n t moving  the photos were awesome
positive:very cool features    great camera with zoom    cool quality pictures    great ringtones    bluetooth feature is great
negtative:the internet functions of the phone  wap and gprs  will only work through tmobile s services  because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network
negtative:i gave up and got a diaper decor
positive:i think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature  and the zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality  with no need to upgrade the earphones
positive:ive seen em all  the archos  dell  ipods  everything    good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion
positive:not only is it the perfect size  not too small  not too large   it also has all the features a hightech phone user would want
positive:strong points   design  small  comfortable  curved  and stylish
negtative:loading cds was somewhat timeconsuming  but i think it would have been with the ipod as well
positive:unless you have an enormous musicaudio book library  the 20 gb model should have more than adequate storage capacity  with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs
positive:the service from the supplier was exceptional
positive:the camera is solid  performs well  takes good pictures  and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the lcd viewfinder
positive:moreover  apart from the plastic cable cover  the camera has a nice  solid feel about it  and it s so tiny  i take it with me wherever i go
negtative:i did n t abuse it  i charged it every day  but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out
positive:definitely a great camera
positive:either way  can t go wrong with this price
negtative:i never know when the champ is full as there is no way too tell  even though not particularly aesthetic  how about making the champ clear and seethrough    so  i lift the lid and find a wad of diaper  which i must remove  usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full
positive:this is an excellent router for the money
positive:the picture quality surprised me  when i first saw this camera i saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good  but i was wrong
positive:great picture quality  in automatic mode  quality is great
positive:i chose this one because from what i read  it was the best deal for the money
positive:first  the battery is replacable by the user  because creative intended it to be  unlike apple with the ipod
positive:3  the remote capture and file viewer software bundled for photo capture is mindblowing
negtative:stylingergonomics  the keys are small  which generally doesn t bother me if they are spaced because i can employ a little braille   but the keys run into each other  so careful attn  must be paid when dialing
negtative:the colors are a joke  and i personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad
negtative:the first one we installed did n t work  and our kids were devastated to say the least
positive:i was looking for a phone which synced with mac osx using bluetooth  had decent battery life  could check email  had good reception  nice screen size and was durable  i break often break small gadgets
positive:before you run out and buy an ipod  understand something  there are reasons the zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle  principally excellent  for mp3  sound quality
positive:although it has chubby hips  the device isn t really so big
positive:i don t know why cnet says there is a problem with focus  i have all my pictures sharp and high quality
negtative:the linksys technical support site has nothing about configuring the router for use with a mac
positive:it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones
negtative:so i emailed the online tech support with that simple question  and got a reply which was totally unresponsive  it looked as though they didn t actually read the email and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs
positive:3  bags are easy to change
negtative:being a past norton customer  i consider this to be a slap to my face
negtative:on the downside  i think the interface takes some getting used to and the zen software
positive:but  dollar for dollar  this dvd player is probably the best out there
positive:at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod
negtative:it s too bad  though  that
positive:i really dislike holding a phone to my ear  and i ve found the free speak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone
positive:it has one more resolution of 1024x768 and a  normal  compression mode  and  it has the 3x zoom
positive:excellent diaper disposal unit
negtative:right now  the creative software transfers subscription music files very slowly
positive:huge storage space  i loaded my entire collection of music  which isnt that much  400 songs  and still have 26 gb  out of the 28 provided to you
negtative:1  it is perhaps too small
positive:but since it s so small  it isn t a big deal to bring it with me
positive:looks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors
positive:for a specific location  i still think its a great phone
negtative:it is some protection for the unit  but for use ability  forget it
negtative:this phone is not suitable for fast people  maybe only for old people
positive:another 5 star performance
negtative:unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n t play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything
positive:this phone has a nice blend of features without going overboard
positive:the menus are easy to scroll through   they are laid out naturally  and make sense
negtative:no matter how accustomed to the phone you become  too much time is required to get to  open and close applications
negtative:games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games
positive:the focus is great  though  if you are not taking a macro shot
negtative:i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts  and both were bad
positive:the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options
negtative:a lot of  fragments  were left in the registry  and it the norton system folders
positive:nikon 4300  i feel  is the best camera out there for the features and price
positive:the leather case it comes with is pretty nice  similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly
positive:the pictures are beautiful  and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere
positive:nis 2003 worked like a charm last year
positive:you need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network
