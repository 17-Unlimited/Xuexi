negtative:also  the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display  so even though the side controls are reachable  i have to open it up to see the display
positive:it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes
positive:i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works  and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers
positive:photo stitch  merge pictures to create a panoramic one   even my old one can do this and it s really cool to have it now still
positive:2  it can be operated with one hand  leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table
positive:firewire  usb2  0  for those fortunate enough to have firewire400  your in for a real treat with auto sync
positive:the phone s sound quality is great  turn up the volume if its too quiet  people  this thing will get loud  i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing
positive:ball metaphor  i was hoping creative hit a home run here  and i think the zen micro is more like a standup double
positive:first  i have to say that i have never had the slightest problem with this camera or the software
negtative:the top did not fit well into the unit   felt defective
positive:the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well re cored mp3s
negtative:you also need to go in and manually remove many symantec files from the registry
negtative:what disappoints me the most that a software like that is not cheap gets zero support form symantec  if you want support  they ll charge you a fee
negtative:some movies it played yesterday  it wo n t play today
positive:i dont know what other people are saying  but the software is awesome
positive:for the price and features it is really good
negtative:the player s mechanics are also flawed
negtative:so yes  as with all software bundled with creative products  it was useless and ugly
negtative:the touch buttons do take a little getting used to and i don t like how the scroll button is the same button used as an  enter  key  but you get used to it and it isn t a big deal
positive:i upgraded from nis 2003  and the change in performance has not been noticeable
positive:when i saw a high gain  low price  antenna was available to the wrt54g router  i thought i d happily give up some  practically unattainable anyway  since you ve got to be in spitting distance from the router  speed in favor of wider coverage
negtative:the flaw is inside the zen
negtative:the headphones are n t the best  but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity
negtative:another irrigation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long  it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on
positive:i also like the fact that you can edit your mp3 titles  etc
positive:the song quality of the ipod is excellent  and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory  for most users
positive:i m not overly fond of green but when i used this hitachi m12v it turns out that now i m very fond of it
positive:retraction  said mine had silver plate  it does have display
positive:i bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and i absolutely love it
positive:it does n t smell like burning plastic when you open the drive
positive:sound quality   phenomenal
negtative:seems the  program scan  feature did not find the exe file for outlook
positive:everything that i have listed above  the zen has  and more
negtative:in noisy environment  it s hard to hear from the earpiece
negtative:but  all of this means nothing  because of the serious  serious  stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw  after 3 months  give or take a few weeks  you won t be able to hear anything
positive:it s easy
positive:i ve had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures
positive:the menu allows you to search for files by artist  genre  and album quite easily
negtative:battery life is not long enough if and only if you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times    the camerabattery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it s normal
positive:i purchased this camera before it went on sale  and while i wouldn t have minded keeping the extra   it was definitely worth it
positive:they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely   as all of my pictures have thus far
positive:2  battery life is over 4  5 hours  compared to about 2  5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons
negtative:the sliding latch is does not stay in place
negtative:34 way through the first disk we played on it  naturally on 31 days after purchase  the dvd player froze
negtative:the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons
positive:you indefinitely appreciate the small size
negtative:navigation could be better  but there is n t really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it
negtative:also much less stinky
positive:other than that  i love this camera
positive:the fact that you can assign ringtones to people andor groups is really cool
negtative:after reading reviews of lcd problems  cracked  black blobs etc  i figured that it was probably a very limited problem
positive:it comes with a good case that fits it snugly
positive:to my ears  a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd  and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player
negtative:while transferring songs to the player  the interface has crashed a few times  45 times in a 45 hour period  normally this would cause me major concern  but it appears that this bug is reproducible  which leads me to believe that creative will fix it with a patched version shortly  or maybe it s just my computer
positive:i ve owned many norton products in my time  and for the most part  i ve been pleased with their performance
positive:a wise investment for the pocketbook  for the nose
negtative:i had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed  mainly the slow processor   and then i couldn t get the damn thing off my computer completely
positive:in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset
positive:it is lightweight  sleek and attractive
positive:this phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones
positive:this is the best camera you can have for digital images if you want to
negtative:the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial  its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment  for those of you who do n t know what a diopter adjustment is  it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight
positive:the m12v has been great
negtative:who in the hell needs a frigging vga camera on their cellphone
positive:the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n t need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk
negtative:the product also leaves a faint smell in the room
negtative:if you currently own the 2003 version  and are looking to upgrade to the 2004 version  don t
positive:this linksys router does it for the right price
positive:third  creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer
positive:i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds
positive:2  4mp is about right for the target market of this camera  semiserious amateur photographer
positive:i love that you can create custom playlists  and organize music in so many different ways
positive:ooh  and i dropped it and it still works fine  this little camera has so many features i have n t even gotten to all of them yet
positive:seriously  this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want
positive:for the price i think this is a remarkably fun mp3 player
positive:the pop up blocker and antispam are bonuses
negtative:no problems now  just a sickly disappointment in the way norton has abandoned their customers
negtative:i was using a motorola t720i with verizon and i had alot of dropped calls and i had troubles syncing data
positive:the champ works great
positive:i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it s nice to know that there re there
positive:given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software
positive:now that i have all my music on it there has n t been any more problems
positive:it holds quite a few diapers  and pops them in quickly and easily
positive:20 gb or 40 gb   the pros of the 40 gb  comes with a  dock station  and double storage space  10  000 songs
positive:the 4300 is a very durable  compact package  and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust
positive:it s easy to use  not too small  and not too big
positive:for the price  i am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup
negtative:does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones  or external receivers  car radio
positive:6  excellent battery life  14 hours beats ipod s
negtative:not compatible with audible  com books
negtative:but the major problem i had was with the software
positive:ripping the songs  even with my 1  1 usb connection is still very quick  and the quality is very good
positive:bottom line is that at 160  this is an absolute steal
negtative:the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said
positive:other than that  i think it is the best router for the money
positive:after upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and emailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine
positive:when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n t get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with
positive:the design of the col lets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craft man  toyjunk  routers i have previously purchased
positive:whether you are a novice or an expert  its ease of use and functionality goes together
positive:a great camera  but here are some points which i don t notice in most of the reviews here  which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer
positive:this camera is ideal for people who want more power  but do n t want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera
positive:it s very solidly built  and has a nice dense feel to it
positive:even viewed cds full of jogs
negtative:but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on it have a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventually the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments
negtative:do n t buy this player
positive:it doesn t bog down under load
positive:the camera res ponce is very quick
positive:it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device
positive:wellbacklit keypad
positive:i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had
positive:the price compared to the ipod is great
negtative:i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused
positive:there are so many functions in this little  yet powerful camera
positive:it has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside
negtative:the player kept displaying  no disc   so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as
negtative:the hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately
negtative:the software  mediasource  can not work on my pc   laptop  intel p42  0  xp os
negtative:the subscription files are still a little slower to transfer  but it s only by about 10 or so
negtative:finally  i reiterate my thumbsdown rating for tmobile as a carrier
positive:on the tmobile service i was able to take pics as we drove across i70 and email them to family  friends once we reached a tmobile tone  usually a major city
positive:decently sized screen  one of the larger ones on the market at 2
positive:well  it was nice while it lasted
positive:i give this product five stars for its usability  performance  expandability  and definitely looks
positive:another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the usb cable
negtative:my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be  at best  a 40gb portable hard drive  albeit one on which i can t create folders  or  at worst  a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again  i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating
negtative:the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover  which is taken off to have access to the battery  seemed to come undone very easily
positive:by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot  i was able to produce excellent stop action photos  contrary to what other reviewers experienced
positive:i  as many others  have waited for many years for the convergence of price  features  size and ease of use to hit that happy center point
negtative:then  my adpopup blocking was completely gone
positive:it has lots of little cute features  my favorite being the games and the pim  personal information manager  i  e  organizer   and the radio
positive:using supplied sw  you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia phone into it
positive:big lcd screen  at least for me  2  is enough
positive:the sound quality is fantastic  cd quality  and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd s or tapes
negtative:if you experience problems with installation  you can visit symantec s website  click the support tab  click the home or home office support  and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it
positive:we were able to obtain a norton corporate edition of antivirus only  no firewall or utilities  and so far it s great
positive:this camera was affordable  very easy to learn  and produces spectacular images
positive:recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card  as expected  i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m4m pixel  fine combos and many of the userfriendly functions are very similar to slr models  and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately
positive:the dual antenna is a plus and the design is slick
negtative:at the very least  a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice
negtative:back in may 2004  when i first reviewed this  it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run
negtative:one drop from a pocket or desktop  and it d be a goner
positive:the edge guide is top quality  easy to install and accurate
positive:i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy  but on full size high to fine quality  the zoomed images are quite impressive
positive:the zen was an impressive purchase and i would highly recommend it to anyone using napster
negtative:i don t know what s happened to norton  but 2004 is absolute garbage
positive:it s oval and    nice
positive:less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer
negtative:this program would not let me send outlook email or listen to audible sample books online
negtative:creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n t as easy as i would have liked
positive:we have been using our diaper champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it
positive:i bought my zen micro three months ago mainly because i preferred the size and style to the ipod mini
negtative:holy cow   it really does scratch easily
positive:bottom line great phone for the time being
positive:the memory  40 gb  is staggering
negtative:i say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working  but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that i could have done if so
positive:i m not gonna go into the features cause if you re reading this review  you ve probably already looked at them  but i must say the dj feature if very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus
positive:manual functionality is excellent  downloading pictures is quick and a breeze  and the quality is astounding
negtative:as it stands now  the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel  or if you load up all your songs beforehand
positive:overall  i highly recommend this phone
negtative:the price is     more
positive:they were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything i have encountered
positive:and for those that are int rested the recharger works anywhere in the world  and is quite small
negtative:there were many times when i clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens
negtative:from day one  we ve had hangups  crashes  glitches  continual reboots  long shutdowns due to  cc app  exe  program running which is a norton program
negtative:it is slightly larger than an ipod  no doubt about it
positive:other plusses  changeable battery  loads of presets for environments  decent construction  still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod
negtative:then when i went to norton s website to obtain a priority id number per the instructions i had been given  i couldn t find a way to get one
positive:both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together
negtative:this time  it started the installation process  then i left for work  i think it will work  i hope it will work
positive:3  it never smelled  at all
negtative:4  the zen  stores  data files  but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk  they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched
negtative:i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd s  after the frustration and aggravation of getting the player to do it s job
negtative:the karma is only 5 more  it s small  had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including gog
positive:in terms of the shots taken  this camera is insanely great
positive:this is the best dvd player i ve purchased
negtative:and i can t warn you enough to stay away from norton
positive:otherwise  this player is awesome
positive:i love it
positive:the depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the m12v than it was on my old router
negtative:doesn t have alot of good games on it
positive:every now and then i spray down the inside of the pail with lysol  easy onehand use impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers out of the pail every now and then odors do escape the pail  but that is rare  and it usually just means that we ve crammed too much in there and need to change the bag
positive:anyhow  this software is working fine and no problems since i installed it two weeks ago
positive:travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket
positive:but  then again  the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office  when i was already out on the street
positive:i love my new nomad  its great
negtative:5  the zen does not have a stop button
negtative:the ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily
positive:lots of flaws  but exceptional sound quality  hd size  and price make it a good buy
positive:with canon  you get pictures that appear to be photos  not still camcorder shots
positive:3  joy stick for eazy navigation  35mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff
positive:i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use  hardware and software   playback quality and value for the price
positive:i ve had this for 3 months now  and i am pleased with my decision
negtative:opening the champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky i pinched my thumb a few times before i got the hang of it
positive:the phones are awesome
negtative:d  software is another great misfortune  hard to operate  crashes frequently  screwed my music library up  doesnt work with mp4s  the list goes on and on
positive:this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer
positive:this camera is closest to perfect than any other diagram that is 45 megapixel
negtative:protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window
positive:i tell you now  after lot of shooting in many different situations  this camera is amazing
negtative:my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons
positive:i found it intuitive to use  i did n t read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes
positive:the buttons are easy to use  and its easy to navigate
positive:fm radio built in  howard stern
positive:the software you get with this camera is perfect
negtative:in addition  i don t believe that it is odorless
negtative:it feels slow to focus  and unbearably slow to shoot
positive:when the router is working it is a very nice machine for the money
positive:i have had no problem either with backward compatibility  in that the  mixed mode  feature lets you both 54 and 11 mb cards off the router
positive:it s so cute    and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue
positive:i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3  in conjunction with my professional flash system   and can easily put up with the cameras limitations  because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits
negtative:apex s website is down and they wo n t answer their phone
negtative:have had problems since the first day
positive:built in microphone is great for recording short voice notes
negtative:pc software that comes with the player is not as simple as i tunes but its not bad at all
positive:1 it has all the features an amatuer photoenthusiast would want
positive:its nice look is also a plus
positive:playlists can be generated on the fly  which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus  or by using the software  and there are a bevy of eq options
positive:i am a big fan of itunes  simply because it is terribly fast and convenient  if you are buying the songs from the itunes site
negtative:getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience
positive:with the right firmware  drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive
positive:there are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router  and everybody is happy with it
positive:another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it
negtative:it does n t have firewire  not a real complaint since most windows users do n t generally have firewire cards themselves
positive:9 3x builtin optical zoom is a lot for this price range
positive:the router works fine for both wired and wireless
positive:this did manage to cut the number of pop ups during startup from 4 down to 2
negtative:the next problem was that it didn t recognize all the installed components  so it would not update them  most notably and importantly  virus definitions
positive:i recently had to run a 34  straight bit through hard maple to make a deep dado and was amazed that this machine didn t even slow down
positive:the menus are very easy to navigate
positive:i also wanted to switch to broad com hardware  which the linksys uses  because my wifi menisci card in my dell laptop with lucien silicon in it used 70 of my 1  2ghz laptop s cpu when using the wireless at full speed
positive:cuts are easy and smooth
positive:1  it uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills
positive:it plays alternate video formats  cads  svcds  cods  very well
positive:at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast
positive:the blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also
positive:but at the same time  it takes wonderful pictures very easily in  auto  mode  so that even an average joe like me can use it
negtative:i simply hate symantec  i swear  if i could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare  bleeding hands  i would have
positive:and i must say    this mp3 is very cool
positive:the player has firmware  which will remove the glitches  if there are any
negtative:its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n t since with contact lists  phone numbers  address books  etc  like the ipod  which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device
positive:this player is an ideal purchase
positive:another point of note  the battery life is incredible
positive:this is a nice feature  i  e  it s early in the morning and you rather listen to  easy listening  rather than  heavy metal   no problem
positive:the heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything i threw at it
negtative:this isn t uncommon in cameras  though  just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries  you should be fine
negtative:not only is it inconvenient  but also the battery life span is short
positive:audio is excellent
positive:i find it very stable and comfortable to use  it doesn t jump around or make me feel like i need to use a lot of arm strength to keep it under control  and it has very good visibility to see your cut
positive:i recently bought the linksys wrt54g router and have been very happy with the router itself
positive:the s100 s image quality rates in the middle of its class  but it can still be a reasonable choice for students  families  or small businesses looking for an ultraportable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack
positive:i was an early purchaser of the wrt54g  and had a few problems with stability and speed  finally  the march 03 firmware update has resulted in an excellent product
negtative:personally  i may never buy symantect products again
positive:utility its got a huge list of features including an fm recorder a calender and contacts list
negtative:i wash ours out with lysol each time i empty it  and that helps  but when its hot out well  just be prepared
negtative:the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking  it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap  and it is a bit slow between shots
positive:it may not top the ipod mini  but it s definitely an alternative if you also want the extra features and good sound quality
positive:so i can t tell you if diaper champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell  but it s excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby
positive:record memos using the built in microphone
positive:learning how to use it will not take very long
negtative:i ve always liked symantec products  except for this version 2004
positive:the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda willa
positive:it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented
negtative:the dynamic range seems not quite as good as the kodak dc260
negtative:the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones
negtative:all in all  trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing creepiness of this very embarassing gift
positive:works pretty well
positive:it s a great looking  easytouse device but it s the sound quality which is truly amazing  far better than my sony minidisc player
negtative:the first one would n t work from the start
positive:i have no problems with the touch pad  once the sensitivity is set to low  and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the pdf manual
positive:first of all  my calls were loud and clear  unlike with sprint
positive:picture quality s great for still and video with sound
negtative:and  other else  the camera is still vga
negtative:the fact that the  0  key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing  as many phones use the    key instead
positive:i bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it
positive:otherwise  it takes very good pictures   shutter delay is n t so bad either
positive:i ve yet to find the limitation for this hitachi  my only hitachi tool  by the way  and quite frankly  i don t know that i have the muscle to push this machine any harder
negtative:a bit disappoint on that
positive:i am now staring at an array of stuff including zen micro player  stereo earbud headphones  a rechargeable lithiumion battery  an acdc power adapter  a usb 2  0 cable  a beltclip  a stand  a stylish cloth pouch  an installation cd  a quickstart guide  and creative mediasource software
positive:this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well
positive:am so glad i bought this camera
positive:great video clip quality for a digital camera  so much better than my old one  canon a60        the 2  0 megapixel one
negtative:imagine my shock  and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex
negtative:door broke after a month
positive:i m in high school  and this camera is perfect for what i use it for  carrying it around in my pocket so i can take pictures whenever i want to  of my friends and of funny things that happen
positive:the pictures are razorsharp  even in macro
positive:but that is good for me because symantec soft wares are a bit hard to master for me who are not savvy on computers
negtative:the headphones are not very comfortable  but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have
positive:excellent sound i mean the player has juice
positive:i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch wide screen dvd s to normal
positive:nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games  graphics and ringtones from www  crazy cellphone  com
negtative:it had a heavier and more sturdy casing
negtative:even on the low sensitive level  a slight touch can skip or pause the track
positive:b  fast mediasource cd ripping  takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc  2  4 hz with 1gb ram  with 52x drive
positive:one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software
positive:i d give it 4  5 stars if possible  but since 5 stars would be misleading  i give it 4 stars
negtative:however  in my mind  299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 months
negtative:one of the dvd s i received as a christmas present kept freezing
negtative:to use the creative zen player with a subscription service  you need to go to creative s web site  and download new software for your pc
positive:one neat thing  i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms  no problem for the camera  rooms looked like they had ample lighting
positive:however  the ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the zen micro  has to offer
negtative:one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does
positive:mine installed no problem  but i did uninstall my norton antivirus 2002  personal firewall 2002 first
positive:it is versatile and seems to be one of the best
positive:the headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when i bought it  a stand  a belt hook  charger  that i know doesn t come with every one
negtative:i had a lot of problems setting it up  since the software given along with it is buggy
positive:i m amazed at the photo quality  prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints
negtative:the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software
positive:fyi  battery doesn t die if you don t use lcd
positive:features  click wheel to navigate   ability to work with windows or mac   optional back lighting  you can have it on all the time  or have it shut off to save battery power after 5  10  or 20 seconds    ability to download pda info   automatic or manual download from itunes when ipod is plugged into your computer
positive:the zen micro is no exception  in addition to the case  it comes with a neck strap  and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging
positive:the in ital setup of the router was simple
positive:if you don t mind all the buttons being touch sensitive  i d re comment buying it to try out  and also buy an extra 2 year warranty for it  there are some offered here  for about 15 dollars i think
positive:it s easy to use  and makes transfering your cd collection to the player a cinch
negtative:unfortunately  it does not give you the option of installing  or installing  them individually
positive:i found that to be the most impressive thing about the ipod mini   basically for ease of use  and the feel it gives
positive:yes  the features are numerous
negtative:as i wrote  this could have been a great product  but expect hidden charges  read gross profiteering and price gouging  as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage
positive:it takes great pictures  operates quickly  and feels solid
negtative:the only problem is the battery life
negtative:i was a little disappointed in the low end
positive:if you have to buy a camera on a bu get  this has got to be the one
positive:whether you re taking a brisk jog  waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park  you ll be glad you had the fm radio
positive:great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price
negtative:the battery issue is superficially a concern  but any reasonable solderjockey  such as myself    can pop in a new one when the time comes  based upon the plentiful info gained from a go ogle for ipod battery replacement
negtative:4  the viewfinder is bordered lcd skying
positive:battery recharge  is an awesome thing  because it recharges in only like 23 hours
negtative:i downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem  but it hasn t worked
positive:the g3 looks like a work of art
negtative:however  i suspect that many people are having a bad experience  do not purchase this product
positive:playlists can be made on the fly  without aid of a computer  and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your  now playing  selections or playlists
positive:i could take 12  passes and it still didn t skip a beat
positive:this is a fantastic tool to use
positive:i must have differing preferences than others here  as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony s that i thought sounded good on other players
negtative:it worked from 1226 to 19 at which time the picture failed completely  see other negative reviewsmy unit was n t the only one this happened to
positive:it films 10 second video  for crying out loud
positive:it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice
negtative:once a depth is locked  it will jump off a little while working
positive:absolutely no problems with this router
positive:while i m not too keen on their customer service  none of the products i have from creative have given me issues   i can definitely recommend the zen micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more    without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth
negtative:i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet
positive:overall  if you know what basic steps to take  it was not difficult to connect  and the sw worked well to connect
positive:it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package
negtative:after consulting with creative s customer support  they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair  which would cost me 40  since it s past the 90 day warranty  pretty short warranty
positive:the soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation
negtative:mine generally requires a charge every 48 hours or so and i don t really talk on it that much
positive:it s easy and really works  with some incredible range
positive:the battery holds a charge for a very long time  maybe 15 or so hours of use  so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with ipod use
positive:on the fly play list creation  address book  removable storage drive capabilities  sound recorder  the list goes on people  this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies  it was like halloween all over again
positive:it s low profile  space saving design looks nice
negtative:i also removed the springs in the plunge tubes to make it easier to raise
negtative:for purposes of clarity  here is my review from that product  edited to be appropriate for this product  since  for the most part  they share many of the same problems
positive:connect the player to your computer  via usb   open up mediasource  and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra
positive:all in all i am pleased with the router
positive:these tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions  and i found the menu to be much more navigable
positive:start up is so quick
positive:looks and shape  i have a black one and the first time i charged it and switched it on jeez the blue light looked so cool
positive:the big backlight makes things easy to see  and the writing is big enough for people to see
negtative:if you are already using a previous version of nortron security and uni stalled it to install the new version  you will still have all kind of problems in installing the new version on your system
negtative:the collet for the 14 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out
positive:its also smaller  and gets more looks
positive:i have transferred in about 2  400 tracks so far  very easy to use both the ipod and itunes
negtative:as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away
negtative:stay away from this product
negtative:it s perfect for those who aren t planning on storing tons of music
negtative:will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles  if you have live albums or greatest hits albums  this will cause you inordinate frustration
negtative:recently the variable speed control went out
positive:great quality picture and features
positive:i love the features  the interface  the size  the screen is a delight   the camera  though i admit i m not much of a camera user  so just a toy for me   the internet connectivity  the quality  etc
negtative:the scroll bar again takes some getting used to
positive:sure  it slows it down a little  but that s expected
positive:can recommend the hitachi in this ergonomic arena  at the price quoted on amazon it is a bargain
positive:player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play
positive:a distinct ipod relation is evident with white colored cables  power plug and the very nice zen case with a white rubber inside covering
negtative:just too numerous to list  fm radio  which has weak reception  but at least it there  and a microphone  to name just two
positive:initially these phones were fun to play with some of the cool features like the speaker phone  web browser and of course the built in camera
negtative:the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings
negtative:don t buy the diaper champ
positive:i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n t take weeks to figure out how to operate
negtative:almost from the beginning  liveupdate would not function
positive:bottom line  if you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services  and are willing to deal with the possibility  not the certainty  of setup gremlins  by all means get the zen micro
positive:the pics can be touched up in photoshop  and be printed at 4x6 and they look great
positive:allinall  creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features  and i look forward to the nomadzen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype
positive:the setup works awesome  as with any tool i look closely at the individual tool for it s merits  and not just the company as a whole
positive:i find all of the controls wellplaced and not flimsy in the least
positive:what i like the most   small and solid feel
positive:just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has
positive:interface  practically seamless
positive:in a week of use i ve never had to reboot the router
negtative:to my amazement  even that process was errorprone
negtative:this one is particularly bothersome  allegedly one can use the zen micro as a portable drive to store and transport data from one computer to another
positive:even the battery life is great  it advertises 14 hours  it s actually a little less but still good
positive:this is a wellmade and powerful tool
positive:the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me  however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate
positive:the zen micro fm receiver is ok  not great
positive:the container is hard to open  which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler  and you do have to flip the handle carefully  which has saved more than a few of her toys  too   i don t consider these difficulties but features for the older baby
positive:the canon is very small  definitely pocket size  but still easy to hold firmly
positive:it fits comfortably in my hand and pocket
positive:despite its being slightly larger than the ipod  i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box
negtative:the touch controls took a little getting used to but now i wouldn t change it for the scroll wheel
positive:the light autocorrection is awesome
positive:i love the storage in this thing
negtative:quite simply  the firmware and  or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time
negtative:another problem is that the latest 2  0 firmware upgrade moves you into windows media player 10 which seems to be very  very slow for downloads  charging2
negtative:the hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as i am now using medium diapers  i have a 3 month old  and they re on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact i make then and how unsoiled they are
negtative:the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warranty period is to expire
positive:its the easiest thing to setup i thought  and i am only 16    so with all that said  buy the router
negtative:my biggest concern is that i have found nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices  but they also don t last as long
positive:it is small  unlike my canon slr  so it easily fits in my pocket
negtative:the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close  a very annoying thing after ah wile
negtative:in any case  navigation by artist  album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders
positive:i highly recommend this
negtative:7  mediasource did not install on my personal notebook
positive:the free  i didnt know they still did that  carrying case is really protective  and to me its the only accessory you need  except good headphones
positive:naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing  i recommend www  no madness  net   and pricewise zens are unbeatable
positive:for the price and size and features  you can t beat the price
positive:this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player
negtative:i d recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop  but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until linksys improves their desktop softwarehardware
negtative:the phone does not have an mp3player  fm radio  200k color screen  megapixel camera  quad band  pda  photo editor
negtative:unfortunately  creative offered scant few pages of instruction  which meant that i was on own from the outset
negtative:the volume key can be hard to press  but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw  perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call
negtative:the phone must be shut down  taken apart to change the memory card    and turning the phone back on takes a little while
negtative:i have a modern pc with lots of speed and memory  but this firewall just brought it to a halt
positive:i love this pail
positive:pertaining to the speed issue  i got 54mps while i was in the same room
positive:the micro seemed like an ipod for less
positive:pi ii 1ghz 512mb rd ram windows xp pro 80gb hd i was able to uninstall nis 2003 and install nis 2004 with no trouble
positive:i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player
positive:overall  the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current  4 megapixel digicams  from a detail  tonal balance and color response point of view
negtative:but if i installed either one of these norton products  neither works after installation
positive:download it fast to your computer
positive:t simply the best player on the market for a really low price  so why look anywhere else
negtative:other things that i miss are voiceactivated dialing and a standard 2  5 mm headset jack
negtative:the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times
negtative:my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units
positive:i m easily enlarging pictures to 8 12 x 11 with no vi sable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet  super fine
positive:not only is it more affordable  but its a better player for windows  which is what i have
negtative:the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n t in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage
positive:i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i m extremely pleased with it
negtative:putting the micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything  unless the hold feature is improved  it asks if you want to  unholy  for every button up press  second  i m worried about the durability of the player
positive:but like i stated  its better then a trash can  but i m not sure if its better then the diaper genie
negtative:the software  which comes with player is not good at all
positive:this really is a great little phone   its got nice features  a beatiful screen  great ergonomics  and its tiny
positive:the edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well
positive:many people have written about the software being its one downfall  personally i have n t had a single problem with the software  i m running windows me
negtative:c  the scroll bar is a travesty  enough said
positive:its silver magnesium finish is stunning  and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen
positive:im a more happier person after discovering the ip button
negtative:i loved it until it broke  but less than a month is not an acceptable period of time for something to work
positive:this is a great deal  and i m elated with my decision to go with hitachi s green machine
positive:at any rate  if you have been interested in digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back  consider the canon s100 digital elph
positive:this unit comes with the usbfirewire cable as a standard item now
negtative:typically  the problem is the headphone jack  it was for me and many others
positive:i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly
positive:this product is amazing and better than the ipod you can get at the same price
negtative:1  quite bulky  it s about the same size as my minolta vectors s1 aps slr  and uses a heavy battery  although not very solid as it is contracted mostly of plastic  unlike canon s elph line
negtative:verdict  had i not needed something with a tad bit more space  i consider this player fair game
positive:it does well in all aspects of internet browsing
positive:but the product is elf is great
negtative:the other pail i used started to smell after 2 weeks of use
negtative:i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs  using a multitude of connection methods  and i still can t get a video signal from the machine
positive:the picture quality of this camera is outstanding  taking its  size and price into consideration
negtative:the digital zoom is crap
negtative:also  their tzones  although cheap   4  99  mo   never works
positive:the player is smaller than you think
positive:believe me when i say this i have used and fingered all nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad
negtative:5  video recorder is of no use and one can not record something useful in 10 seconds and it takes a while to send the same through the  free picture and video messaging  offered by service provider
positive:have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility
negtative:the cons  at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth
positive:this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it
positive:with accessories  you can make the ipod into a digital recorder  broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology  and play it through your car speakers using either a cd adaptor or fm stereo broadcaster
positive:i bought this camera two days ago  and i m very pleased to say that it has been worth the money
positive:although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department  it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do  to be a wireless telephone
positive:everything  so far  has worked flawlessly
positive:hate to wait between shots
positive:actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated
positive:you do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the champ
positive:and it holds so much music and audio files
negtative:the buttons are rather stiff
negtative:there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours
positive:i have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it
negtative:it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs  it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies
positive:i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my apple power book
negtative:as for the zen micro   cons  i read that every button is touch sensitive  and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front
positive:8  perhaps inspired by the canon s factory whitecorrection settings  which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out   the g3 has much sharper white offsets
positive:the only free help you get is in renewing your subscription
negtative:it also has a stock tracking app built in  also useless  and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics  currency  length  area  etc
negtative:seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection
positive:ks almost without fail  no matter what your taste in music is  from relaxation music to hard rock  to hip hop  to korean and japanese  to afrocuban and salsa  jazz  blues  country and pop  this feature performs well
positive:we just use the glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from target and they work wonderfully
negtative:the only notsopositive comment i have is about the depth adjustment  it is not easy to microadjust accurately
positive:the dvd player is fine
positive:in minutes i was easily navigating through the menus
positive:this is a great product
positive:among my requirements for a phone were  good screen  decent camera  bluetooth  and gprs support
positive:the lcd screen was very large and readable
positive:i love the features on the ipod and the many things you can do with it
positive:it fits into a hand well  it has a removable battery  this is important   great sound quality  fm stereo  recorder  smooth ui  and a feature that most uni pods lack    char
negtative:buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks
positive:the software has n t been a hassle for me at all
negtative:norton support is completely pathetic
positive:the manual mode is feature rich and i can t wait to get the hang of it
negtative:in fact  i d have to rate it among the worst i ve ever encountered
positive:i do n t always care for gracenotes  genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags
positive:the latest of internet security has antispam function that is helpful because i has received a mountain of those these days
positive:i d be happy to talk to anyone about this camera
positive:after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace  i decided on the s100
positive:the camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great  not as good as prints from my pro digital camera  but still very good
negtative:i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective
positive:i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision
positive:so far it all works fine with either cable or wireless connections
positive:audio is mono and fairly acceptable  quiet also with little distortions
positive:fits well in hand in trouser pockets
negtative:but those 2 come up every time
positive:however since this router is backward compatible  that doesn t pose a problem at all
positive:the phone also sports an image gallery  with option camera attachment   a calendar  organizer  alarm clock with snooze  fm radio  way cool  even if it is just through an earpeice   games  java applications and gprs highspeed internet connection
positive:another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty 500 price tag and get a quality camera
negtative:i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance  less than 2 ft
positive:i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not  like my apartment
positive:remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s
negtative:after multiple tries  one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available
positive:the height is a more convenient reach than others  where you have to hunch over
negtative:sometimes when you press buttons  the menu appears after a second or two
positive:the mobile text messaging  chat  picture sharing etc  other niceties  that you would enjoy
positive:the automode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n t played with it too much on manual
positive:the sound is amazing
negtative:this is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support
positive:the design and construction are excellent  as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics
negtative:there is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the  knowledge  database at linksys  com  and first tech support person i spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour  then gave me a web site address to consult  that turned out to be the one i d already found during a search of my own
positive:i would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn t for the fact that i would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone
positive:we keep the diaper champ in our daughter s nursery and her room definitely does not smell like dirty diapers
positive:and so far  i ve been very pleased
negtative:we constantly got  windows virtual memory low  error messages popping up foll wed by ridiculous slowdowns andor crashes
negtative:its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily  not great from a cosmetic standpoint
positive:and we still love it
positive:i am enjoying my phone a lot
negtative:this product is absolutely not ready for release
negtative:8 buttons are little  but if you have steady fingers and deal ed with a casio worst calculator watch  you can deal with almost anything
positive:transfering is easy  the software makes everything pretty easy
negtative:who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a  foreign  computer just to move over some simple    txt  files
positive:second  the setup cd actually worked perfectly
positive:after getting used to the m12 all the rest seemed lacking
negtative:it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen  and if the button did n t cover up the ac jack
positive:the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to
negtative:configuring it for a home network was almost impossible
negtative:mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash  where it belongs
positive:the battery stays charged for a long time  and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter
negtative:basically the 6600 is a bundle of overhyped features you don t and won t need  if you do get yourself a pda or pocket pc   none of them work as they should  and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average
negtative:the speed control is recessed too far in the housing and required a tool  screwdriver or dowel rod  to effect any speed change
positive:secondly  all info can be sent to a computer and wo the hassle of usb wires
negtative:i did have to cut off the ears that hold the template guide in place so i could get those big panel raising bits in it
negtative:however  configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours  and briefly made me reconsider my choice to for ego the airport and its notoriously easy setup
negtative:i have used norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years  the software has gotten more and more disgraceful
positive:i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer
positive:the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem  battery charger  usb and video cable
negtative:it is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it
positive:the sound quality is also nice    after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with
positive:the new canon s300 is 33 larger and 26 heavier than the s100
negtative:there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board
positive:transfer through windows explorer  windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk  so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad
positive:i have really enjoyed the camera on this phone
negtative:2  the delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots
positive:great product  easy to use  economical  effective  absolutly fabulous
positive:after using it  i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket
positive:as i mentioned before  the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said  though notmad may still work better
negtative:also  the player sometimes freezes  not a very big problem  but can also be annoying
positive:i researched and researched between getting the canon s20 or the canon s100  and of course i got the latter
positive:capacity is not a problem here
positive:the blue backlight is pretty cool
negtative:it is the first generation  of the player  and while i still agree that it is a great alternative to the ipod  i think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck
negtative:3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything
negtative:so  you might inquire  why don t they make it a first priority to carefully  simply explain how download music from your music library to their device       this seems academic to me
positive:unarguably better than apple s  and nice earbuds to boot
positive:its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently  lying on bed 38   phone lying by your pillow side
positive:for those of us that like to tinker  i think creative offers some advantages
negtative:if there was a zerostar rating i would give it
negtative:but now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using freshener
negtative:i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all
negtative:i was impressed by this very inexpensive player  for the first three hours  and then it died
positive:this isn t the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play airplane with this  are you
positive:for instance  i made several backups of my dvd movies using dvdr  w  and  r  w  and it plays the dvds
positive:the lcd is larger than the previous model  the nx  and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx s green backlight did
positive:it is so small that i am able to keep it in my pocket  and i don t have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable
positive:this phone is very userfriendly  easy to manipulate 38   very convenient to scroll in menu etc
positive:it works with a minimum of fuss
positive:the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks  spills my beer  but does n t wash my car
positive:after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures
negtative:the electronic speed control is not doing it s job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will
positive:the best 4 megapixel4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use
positive:freebies you get  a cradle with detachable stand and belt clip  some thing very handy and useful
positive:they are extremely convent and you don t have to buy them seperately has itunes  which provides quality music at low prices
negtative:3  it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer  like some players
negtative:another thing i don t like is that some of the features take 12 seconds to load up
positive:the music plays awesome  never skips  even if u run for a bit  so you can listen to music without interruption
positive:likewise  i ve heard norton 2004 professional version is fine too
negtative:i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n t play certain disney and other dvd movies  no disc message
positive:some features that the zen micro  has that sold me on my purchase include  a 5g hard drive    actually an sd flash card drive    very large and much more than actually needed  the ability to sync with microsoft outlook s calendar  the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours  i can change the battery myself for about 40 to buy vs
negtative:within a year  there are problems with my menu dial knob
positive:this is a great camera for you
negtative:the keys are close together  and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads  but it s not too weird
positive:i use the scented bags and even if i don t no smell
negtative:the environmental audio  however  is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it  i encode my songs at 192256 kbps without variable bit rates
positive:the device looks very cool  i think  exactly as the photos promise   it s comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket  and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice
positive:allinall  this is another excellent creative product
positive:i almost always get a good strong signal  even in fairly remote areas here in the southwest
negtative:the general button placement is not very user friendly
negtative:they really are awfully small
positive:creative did an awesome job with the design
negtative:problems with the sound quality were evident right away  but even i couldn t imagine they d be that bad
negtative:it does not have an autofocus assist light which is nice for taking shots in lowlight situations it allows the camera to focus in low light
negtative:there was occasionally a lipsync issue  the lips were n t moving in time to the dialog
negtative:negtative
positive:the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light  and the 4times optical zooms gets you just that much closer
negtative:i really regret signing up with tmobile  but i m stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract
positive:but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it  and gotten timely responses  they will fix it for me if necessary
positive:in conclusion  i gave the ipod a 45 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly
positive:i ve taken about hundred shot with the canon  in varying lighting situations  all in auto mode  and not one blurry picture
negtative:i have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone
positive:the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful  easy to use  high quality  and compact in size
positive:when it s working  it s great but it is very temper mental
positive:overall it is the best camera on the market
negtative:if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred  you will become frustrated quite quickly
positive:this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made
negtative:images taken indoor were n t so clear
positive:i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330  but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse
positive:i ve dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces  and it still works flawlessly
negtative:after years with that carrier s expensive plans and horrible customer service  portability seemed heavensent
positive:the twotimes optical zoom operates smoothly and quietly  and lo and behold  a twopiece shutterlike cap automatically slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off
positive:also  multiple picture feature is very  very fast
negtative:if you ve been listening to cd s in your car for awhile  dealing with the dropoff in sound quality may take some getting used to
negtative:i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand  but with my experience and reading the other reviews  i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product
positive:i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk  by accident  as well as have played it outdoors in  30 fahrenheit weather  by design  and it has continued to work fine
positive:i am able to carry it close to my body  in places where other phones are not so easily concealed
negtative:focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time  pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange
positive:you can record your voice and turn it into a ringtone
positive:the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat  clean clear and well focused on over 95  of all photos taken by a beginner
negtative:i had tried to uninstall norton internet security a few weeks ago  and it wouldn t let me do that either
positive:this router works at 54mbps that s megabyte not kilobyte
positive:this is the best phone i have seen
positive:i love the es based controls and easy menus
negtative:one caveat i have is that i understand the ipod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved
positive:the autofocus performs well  but i love having the 12 optional scene modes  they are dummyproof  and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera
negtative:it s a rip off if one buys norton internet security and antivirus
negtative:less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows  no disc
negtative:i find this feature on this phone useless  but  since i don t really need this function anyway  i don t really use it
negtative:and  when you think about it  it s insulting that norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops  anyone who can provide proof of purchase  whether on the phone or online  what if your computer is down     should have equal priority
positive:but you can download some really good ones like pacman or mafia wars
positive:with all its complicated features  the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great
positive:it is crystal clear
positive:the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera  plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders  great closeup mode  long lasting rechargable battery  etc etc
positive:but this camera is great
negtative:screen review could be better
positive:overall the phones fantastic  and i would have given it 5 stars  but its not perfect
positive:11  minimal pause between songs  less than that on other devices  good achievement for a harddrive based player
positive:however  there is a more detailed pdf manual on the cd  and online  that should answer any questions about the operational features of the zen micro
positive:ive had this phone for a year now  and its the best phone i have owned
positive:1  great sound   98db signaltonoise ratio beats ipod s  unspecified  ratio  and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large headphones as well as external speakers
negtative:i have noted that as you use the tool  sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention
positive:i use this with a home theater system and it s amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched
negtative:purchased the ad2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it
positive:i have an ipod and it is a great buy
positive:very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera
positive:this was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit
positive:applications  it has lots of applications and they work very well    when you eventually find where they are and they finally open
positive:much cheaper than ipod good looking player  beautiful blue backlit screen  if you ve read about the player  some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on  but this is good because the face does n t get damaged  scratched fast transfer rate
positive:it also costs a lot less than the ipod
positive:i recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers
negtative:now this router is not the cheapest on the market
positive:the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away
positive:it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily
positive:i am just in love with this phone  especially after using a more primitive phone about 3 years
negtative:the opening could be a little wider  i suppose  but i haven t really seen anything else that could be improved
positive:i first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot
positive:so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost
negtative:it has a 3x optical zoom  which is average for these cameras
negtative:i have noticed an odor  one the i expected    when unloading the diaper champ but at least you don t smell anything every time you use it
negtative:don t use them  so i delete them for addle space
positive:uploading the images to my windowsbased pc is very fast and simple
negtative:sometimes  various applications crash
negtative:the onoff button feels somewhat flimsy  and has an awkward  tiny little lockout button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera
negtative:and if you re a mac user like me  they ve naturally made sure you have no viable alternative
negtative:6  the case occludes the display screen when it is closed
negtative:soso 1  customer service  6 calls half were efficient other half were equally incompetent
negtative:nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software
negtative:in fact  it caused my system to hang more times than not  so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100
negtative:on here of course  also  a couple dvd s would n t play and they were new ones
negtative:the customer support is pathetic
negtative:but  sometimes  if the champ is too full  the flip handle won t function
negtative:within one month  my player completely died
positive:also  the nomad s 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy
negtative:overall  it does its basic function very well  but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the zen micro does not rise to the occasion
positive:the pictures are fabulous and their is a  short  learning curve to it   there are tons of features i have n t even gotten to
positive:a few of my work constituents owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality
positive:it plays just about any format  check before you buy if it plays yours
positive:5  bluetooth wireless technology  so that i can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables
positive:everything else about the camera is great
positive:you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly
positive:they say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact
negtative:it s important that people know the following  first  the interface is slow
positive:1  slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative  yet its program and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n t want to bother with the settings
positive:otherwise  i am extremely please with the creative zen micro 5gb mp3 player
positive:the nokia 660 runs the symbian os  which works pretty well for most standard phone fare  most of the stuff is not that intuitive  but if you actually learn how to use it all  there s plenty of neat tieins
positive:look at the size of it
positive:i bought it for my trip to buns aries  and also used it at the iguassu falls  and could not have asked for more perfect performance
positive:the good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges  i had a new zen
positive:first of all the player s sound quality is superior to the ipod
negtative:buying software that can not be installed normally and being put into the position of having a nonworking computer
positive:c  i do love audio sync which allows a oneclick synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer
positive:you can use it as a storage hard drive
positive:the software comes with plenty of defaults genres
negtative:in short  nokia themselves don t know that this phone doesn t work with the palm  and if you don t heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts  chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly
positive:this player is absolutely phenomenal  i haven t had any problems  and if you re worried you will have problems  i suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways    i find the touch pad very easy to use  and i m surprised so many people have had problems
negtative:what this product really needs is better documentation for how to set up the router for different operating systems
positive:also  the display is  hinged  and it can be placed in a myriad of positions  or to protect it against any damage
negtative:what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical
negtative:what the hell is wrong with this thing
positive:if you are looking for an upgrade  this is definitely the phone for you
positive:the software is very easy to use  and within 30 minutes of opening my box  i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds
negtative:this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n t purchase it
positive:the panorama setting is unbelievable
positive:i take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice
positive:all in all though i m very happy with my new mp3 player
negtative:downside is the size of the phone  it is big for today s standard
positive:for the person that uses the equipment every day  pay the extra and get a reliable  safer unit
positive:sound quality is amazing  i was expecting worse  but its really good  especially if your files have good sound quality
negtative:sure they say if it s their fault you won t get charged  but they are the ones who get to decide whether it s their fault
negtative:yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion  i do n t like it too but no harm done since i always use the cam ea lcd screen to see exactly what i m going to get  in the viewfinder when you do n t zoom  when you zoom the lens distortion goes away   canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon   that is what lamest exactly ot the picture
negtative:depressing the scroll button  for selecting  is not always responsive
positive:i like the speed control
positive:it works easily with one hand  which is important
positive:while i like the performance of the phone in every regard  i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it
positive:diaper champ is by far the best diaper pail
positive:another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i ve seen
positive:what makes the focuslock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8
positive:simple and it works
positive:when you turn on your player  the player turns on really fast  and the music continues to play  as you left it when you were turning it off
positive:all in all  this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price
negtative:also  for those that complain that the diaper champ isn t as effective as time passes  keep the following in mind  as babies get older  their diets changes  aka solid foods    and so does the smell of their diapers
positive:while the perfect odor free diaper pail has yet to be invented  the diaper champ is a good as it gets
positive:i still give the ipod five stars  though  as it could have been something i did incorrectly during the install  though i did follow the onscreen prompts  so i ll give apple the benefit of the doubt
positive:if you haven t noticed  they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the selftimer
positive:it looks great  and is loaded with features
positive:i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit
positive:they could be more comfortable  but no complaints in the sound department
negtative:there are 2 things that need fixing first is the battery life  it will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons
positive:battery life is ok
negtative:the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air
negtative:again  this is a design flaw in the headphone
positive:it seems to be working fine  but we ve not used it all that much
positive:the program is fully featured  with much of what you d want from a security program
negtative:im at full capacity         i called syman tic and they said they don t know why but i should get tech s support at 35hr to help     i did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes until i hung up
positive:that s it for now  what are you doing still reading this  click the  add to cart  button already
negtative:is it necessary to scan my ms money database when i close the program
positive:the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product
negtative:another thing you should know  the metal on the flip side of the ipod is very tacky  and scratches very easily
positive:the sound is awesome  but if u put it too loud  depends on your sound quality  the sound might crack
positive:you don t need to cough up an extra couple bucks for a  special edition  to get black    sound  awesome    batteries  removablereplaceable
negtative:player has a problem with duallayer dvd s such as alias season 1 and season 2
positive:i feel much less likely to drop this phone than others  which are actually starting to get too small
negtative:other tagging problems result  i think  from the nomad s operating system
positive:value  comparing data storage with price
positive:their products have been great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions
positive:well  this apex dvd player turned out great
positive:it is small overall  bigger than the ipod  but keep in mind that this is because different  less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx
negtative:as with most headphones that come with any type of music player  i recommend throwing these into the nearest river  unless you like having hard  round pieces of plastic in your ears
negtative:i was willing to live with the larger size  inconvenient on the road  but the durability was a big zero
negtative:also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n t always accurate
negtative:after research of other creative hard drive players  i found that most of them aren t very durable and tend to crash  read most reviews on amazon  com and see for yourself
positive:they also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like panasonics and sennheisers
positive:6  the phone is really wide  which seems to be a turnoff for many people  but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic
positive:the eax features are pretty cool  as well  as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that  for example  compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train
positive:you can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it
negtative:i have read the installation instructions for both nis 2004 and navy 2004 prior to installation  but still ended up with the same result    junk software
positive:the screen is large  defined  and easy to read  and the silver unit is naturally cool
positive:i find that it is stable in my hands and its  weight actually contributes to that stability
positive:the optical zoom is awesome  and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom
negtative:well  i got my second player  and right out of the box it wasn t working right and once again  after consulting customer se
negtative:it s not the heaviest around  i think portercable has that distinction   but i found its combination of weight and power really too much to allow precise handheld operation
positive:the music is easy to get to  all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of ipod owners say  and if you know how to search for an artist by name online  then you can do the same with the zen
negtative:it took several days of attempts before things finally  worked  again and i have n t a clue why
positive:i purchased two of these beauties
positive:i like the nomad s color better  but it s not terribly flashy
negtative:the included memory card is too small
negtative:my ipod freezes occasionally  which is especially annoying when you re in the middle of a game of  brick
positive:getting the router setup in a  vanilla  configuration that works for 99 of users was very easy  and i was able to do this no problem
positive:on the upside  the phone has amazing battery life
positive:the phone is sturdy
positive:i can recommend this phone to anyone  anytime
negtative:one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card  and for most purposes  it is not enough
positive:and really this is the best phone one could have
positive:holds a lot of diapers  a full week of toddler diapers
positive:still  i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features
negtative:i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose
positive:the nomad is not ugly  it is not that big  it comfortably fits in my pocket  or heavy  and the controls are not hard to get used to
positive:i ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy
positive:i bought this little guy a few weeks back  and i have to say that i never had so much fun with a new toy as this
negtative:the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens
positive:it was a very quick setup and installation  in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up
positive:a digic iipowered imageprocessing system enables the sd500 to snap a limitless stream of 7megapixel photos at a respectable clip  its startup time is tops in its class  and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition
positive:the darn thing works as promised and it s amazingly cheap too
positive:the player works well with my sony srsa 202 powered speakers
positive:this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has
negtative:i find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can t tightly bundle it without a mess  the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is outside of the diaper pail
positive:the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery  just like any other batterypowered appliance
negtative:i don t know  maybe i got a defective one but first  the player would not shut off  next  the player would not come on  i had to send it away to get repaired
negtative:i tried calling the support number for a week  several times a day  and always got a busy signal
negtative:well  my second one is now beginning to hi cup a bit after about 1 12 years
positive:the good  small size   durableseeming metal case   easy to use   visually distinctive   good picture quality   fast usb connection   mostly intuitive operation   really cool photostitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas
positive:the use of 65536  16bit  colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone
positive:i must say  i think this is the coolest camera i ve ever owned
positive:this one is really great
negtative:it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc
positive:the blue backlit lcd looks really neat and is easy to read
positive:the zen plays mp3  wma and wave formats  which makes it more versatile than the ipod
positive:and it is very easy to clean
positive:i highly recommend this phone to anyone
positive:one primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that i could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux  where soft modem drivers are hard to find  and don t work very well
negtative:i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust
negtative:i tried the cd setup program without any luck
negtative:it barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzes all over the player  because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart
positive:what an upgrade
positive:4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros  and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera
positive:the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger  nowblue backlit screen  which is infinitely better
positive:well the champ has survived it s first year with our son and it is great
positive:yes  i recommend it over the competition
positive:i recommend tmobile and the nokia 6600 without reservation
positive:thankfully  creative has come through with a product that puts the ipod back in its place
positive:remember  this phone uses an operating system  symbian    and it s featurerich w 65k colors
positive:sound quality was the same between the two  but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features
negtative:the most recent is that it will stop responding to the onoff button
positive:the manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance  but there is no manual focus or manual exposure
positive:i would recommend this camera unequivocally
negtative:i couldn t get the install wizard to work
negtative:after some research on the net  i discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current wrt54g design  wrt54g  version 3  which amazon currently sells
negtative:the biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin s player was relatively new  it was riddled with scratches
negtative:buttons do seem a little sticky tho   and the hands free kits  connector might be a problem
negtative:i have never had this problem with any other software on my computer
positive:i compared it to other cd players  two models of panasonic  rio  samsung  and they were no way even near zen micro
negtative:scroll button  the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter  but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling
negtative:the eax sound enhancement feature did n t do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq
negtative:i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the  rigor  of a business traveler
negtative:my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of
negtative:the machine itself seems fine  but the software that came with it is awful
positive:3  play java games on it
positive:i loved this product when i first got it  great sound  easy to use  even though i agree that the software was n t the best  and held enough songs to suit any mood
negtative:i send my camera to nikon for servicing  took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem
negtative:i left the camera in my car in maine  not a very hot place  and the lcd screen cracked
negtative:only used for 3 month before it s down
negtative:if you do n t have tags  it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders
positive:however  its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70  of the shots that i take
negtative:booting up my computer took forever
positive:i wanted this product because i didn t have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended
negtative:i ve since replaced it with a pair of black sennheisers    not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable  but are too similar to ipod s and can target ipod thieves here in nyc
negtative:it does take some getting used to
positive:no offense to amazon  but i was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks  i m sure prices here will continue to sink   and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space
positive:2  storage capacity
positive:it s easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn t have clumsy and confusing  not to mention expensive  refills
negtative:no line out jack  as i said  there is none
negtative:however  the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality
negtative:1 no direct firewire to the camera
positive:also  it was only  39  99  after rebate  with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player
negtative:although the soundquality is good  it takes more than good sound on a portablemp 3 player to result in a good product
positive:i love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it
positive:i have had several mp3 players over the past few years  and have to say that this by far is the best that i ve owned
negtative:knocked 1 star off for the install wizard  it wasted alot of time running it
negtative:apparently  tmobile is heavily backlogged and can t keep up with demands
negtative:weak points   touch pad  design could be better  volume control  controlled through the vertical strip  but purchasing a headphone with builtin volume control will do the trick
negtative:what a junk
positive:this setup using the cd was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time
positive:it is quiet and has plenty of power
negtative:i registered for this item because of the good reviews it got  however i was not impressed
negtative:again  every review written about the tech line is true    after waiting close to 45 minutes i finally spoke to a rep
positive:if you are looking for a phone to integrate as easily as the sonyericsson phones with isync  i say stick with a sonyericsson
negtative:i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work
negtative:i then realized a major design flaw
positive:it sure does
positive:this phone is fantastic
positive:the design  as mentioned above  is sleek  cool and trendy  and i think trendy  good  but it s always hard to tell these days
negtative:i am giving a zero star to symantec for this version
positive:from the internet  woodworking books  local stores and personal opinions the hitachi m12v 314 hp router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price
positive:to set up the box  wap  and ether nest bridge  with the encryption on was less then 30 mins
positive:it s faster than wmp
negtative:if you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product  save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version
positive:this camera is great if you re used to a highend slr
positive:great sound   i was very impressed  i encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great  especially with the better headphones
negtative:i find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much
positive:i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player
positive:this router acts as a wireless access point  100 mb switch and a router making it a nice multipurpose device
positive:zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player
positive:thank you apple   you make fabulous products
negtative:it has never worked
positive:it looks sleek and modern
positive:it is much easier to fill and unload than the diaper genie  plus  why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the dollar store
positive:this player seems to work fine with everything else
positive:took me a few tries to get use to the navigation  but it s a very user friendly player imo
positive:it is a multifunction phone  reception quality is better than the 610
positive:it s easy to install the security on this product but linksys doesn t do a good job of explaining why its important
positive:you can create playlists  drag  drop songs and playlists to your player  and rip directly from cd to your player
negtative:1  the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod  and it weighs a little bit more
negtative:well just one con  its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it  it will be a breeze
positive:in conclusion  this player is beautiful
positive:i was worried about what the sound quality would be like  but that seems to be just as good as the actual cd sound
positive:i must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be
positive:operating its many features is easy and often obvious  i m no annie levitts  but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store
positive:the screen is bright  easy to see in the daylight  with nice colors
positive:the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it
positive:this may be a really cool phone  but it s not worth it with tmobile
negtative:i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse
positive:pros  1  speed 2  signal strength 3  advanced configuration options
positive:the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior
negtative:i have overall been disappointed with nokia in the past  finding that samsung and motorola tended to have better quality phones
positive:let the champ win you over
positive:it s being used daily and i have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers  headphone jack  player locking up  etc
positive:allinall  i believe this is arguably the best nonslr digital camera on the market
positive:sound i m no audiophile but i was amazed by the clarity the player had  it was much better than the sound card on my computer and louder too
negtative:my last simpler nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use
negtative:the box proudly displays  securest  tm    wireless made simple   one touch setup button   easy start   easy security   easy everyday  apparently linksyscisco knows that ease of setup is crucial
positive:also  the wma compression format is superior to mp3  especially at lower bit rates  so i needed a player that could handle wma and integrate well with my windows xp computers
positive:it s overkill for simple snapshots  unless you ve got way too much money to blow
positive:the sd500 rivals the canon g6 in image quality
negtative:this was obviously a conspiracy as it is freak in  easy to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries
negtative:controls are a bit awkward
negtative:tech support from apex is literally  nonexistent
positive:this is my first digital camera  and i am very pleased with it
positive:using the software itunes is relatively simple  you just plug the usb cable in  wait your machine to detect the ipod and voila  any songs listed in your itunes library will be transfer ed on over to the ipod
positive:this is the first cell phone i ve owned  and overall  i am quite pleased with it
positive:the pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect
positive:also  very light and portable
positive:anyway  this player is a great deal and i really love it
positive:getting files onto it is quick and painless
negtative:it wouldn t always work seamlessly with wmp and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it
positive:handset quality is great  as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality
positive:but  for the money it is a good machine
positive:also  it takes any kitchen sized trash bag  so there is no special bag to stock
positive:it took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn t called me yet with any problems
positive:this product is by far the best broadband router on the market  i bought this to replace one of those linksys instant wireless b routers  worked great for about a year
positive:power for the techsavvy  ease of use for the less fortunate
negtative:apex sucks
positive:in low light with flash i found it clear better then the sony p200  too much red  colours overall not as natural but fewer redeyes
positive:first  the zen lets you sync to more than one computer
negtative:it s not as stylized as a sony or samsung
positive:the battery life is not that of the casio s but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opinion with the battery life youve got
positive:no down time  great signal strength
positive:the quality is significant and you ll be very happy from saving time and the headache
positive:the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras  the battery needs to be charged while in the camera  but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery
positive:there are a lot of things i like about it
negtative:the catch is it s built like a piece of crap
negtative:as a portable player  it should feel a bit more durable
positive:the software could n t be better and the mp3 player works like a dream  i could n t give this anything but a 5  i wish there was a 6
positive:this program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another
positive:for more than a year  and it is totally reliable
positive:simple click buttons  back buttons volume and display are very easy to read  access and use
negtative:after  3 months  it stopped playing higher number scenes on dvds
negtative:but not good enough for me
negtative:some features in the user interface
negtative:this phone doesn t include phone card calling
positive:usb 2  0 transfer is insanely fast
positive:built like a tank  yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the leigh dovetail jig
positive:creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and  yes  charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie
positive:digital zoom is clear too    say you used all 3x optical zoom  try to do digital zoom then    just try not to shake the camera at all and you ll still get a clear good quality picture
positive:i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it
positive:have had the player since xmass and love it
positive:so much safer than the others that require a two handed operation
negtative:buttons size is ok for me  my wife  but not my granny
negtative:the lcd screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones
negtative:after 4 attempted installs  i have finally given up
negtative:when talking the voice is not very clear
positive:the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used
negtative:after i had it a couple weeks  it got into a state where it could never find the device  no matter how often i rebooted my pc  reset the device  reloaded drivers  etc  etc  creative s online support was no help at all
positive:this is my fourth linksys product and  aside from the rough start  i m very satisfied with this router
positive:the scroll button seems ok  i have no problems with it
positive:3 band and you can just change the sim card in it to be able to use it in europe with another service provider
positive:as for bluetooth  no problems at all
positive:i ve used the corporate edition at work without any problems ever
positive:it s still alive  still kicking  and still playing
positive:the sound quality is superb  much better than that of an ipod  in my opinion
negtative:the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed
positive:great phone  i d buy another
positive:the included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well
positive:this phone is highly recommended otherwise
negtative:also  some other mp3 players such as the nitrus allow you to play wma  windows media audio  files  whereas the ipod does not
positive:the extra gb of hard rive space  remove able battery and fm tuner  as well as the fact that i was previously a satisfied owner of the nomad ii put it over the top for me
negtative:it s not my first choice in cameras
positive:also i like the position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn t have any extra knobs or gizmos
positive:because of it s hidden features  no macro vision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s
positive:it is extremely light and disappears in your pocket
positive:7  chic look and good build  the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate
negtative:the other thing i do n t like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated
positive:i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n t had any problems
negtative:i tried to call norton  and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for nontech customer service  tried this one and hung up after 75 minute of muzak  or they have a 30 techsupport number
positive:i have a hard time using other phones with smaller screens
negtative:this camera keeps on outfoxing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped
positive:i ve connected the phone with two laptops and a ipa 4155
positive:the installation  setup  and operating interfaces are well organized and intuitive and the email spam component works well
positive:i couldn t believe what i had been missing
positive:it will read and play all cd audio disc
positive:its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wideangle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake
positive:navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch
negtative:the interface used could be better designed
positive:don t worry this player rocks
negtative:the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch
positive:other than that  this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips
positive:it holds a lot of diapers  not to mention the odor
negtative:apple still does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini
negtative:i m giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable
positive:so far i have no complaints with this player
positive:putting in mp3 player  lots of games and application to download
negtative:that said  i am disappointed in the plunging mechanism
positive:the screen is clear and readable  and the touch pad works very well  it took me less than a day to get the hang of it  and now i like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control
negtative:all in all  the diaper champ serves its purpose  but it does not live up to its good reviews
negtative:the navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy
positive:bottom line  well made camera  easy to use  very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense  filters choices
positive:for the most part this is a good dvd player
positive:glad to see the ed  revised the previous statements regarding image quality
positive:i wanted standard memory expansion  cf cards   macro mode  and if possible  a waterproof housing  for kayaking
positive:we ve never experienced odor from the pail
negtative:flash  as with all builtin flashes in small cameras  you get over illuminated main subjects with depth being lost
positive:just point and shoot and the photos were great
negtative:got way too many blurry pictures
positive:this makes for a great phone
positive:by far this seems to be the best value out there for the money   if you are undecided  the creative zen micro seems to be the best choice
positive:having the digic ii chip helps a lot
negtative:then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not
positive:i have to say that i am very happy with it so far
negtative:on average  indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm
positive:right out of the box  i loved it  better features than the ipod  great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources i can use
positive:i like the size and weight of this little critter
positive:it s fast  feels great in your hand and looks great too
negtative:i ve read about the issues with the scroll bar  but they must have taken care of that now
negtative:i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes
positive:personally  i am very pleased with the diaper champ
negtative:for one thing  the diapers always get jammed in it
positive:overall though  i m very happy with it and highly recommend it to folks looking for a mp3 player  even if it is to pretend your not a brain dead consumer giving into the marketing hype of the ipod
positive:everything else about the ipod is great  the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it
negtative:the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen  the front panel refused to clip in correctly  leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player
positive:battery life  the drawback to most digital cameras  to quote k  reeves
negtative:then the most disappointing was trying to use viper raised panel bits that just barely fit  and i mean just barely
positive:5  the camera installed on this phone is awesome
positive:its ability to serve as a backup for my music collection is a huge plus
positive:the included earphones are pretty good  my advice
positive:3660 had similar features  but that is big in size
negtative:3  the lack of an intermediate resolution setting  as other reviewers have suggested  is a problem  but that problem is meaningless with a larger compactflash memory card
negtative:the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n t figure out a way to break it
negtative:seemed like a good deal  but this pps frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds  takes a long time loading and then concludes   no disc
negtative:i tried disabling the various components provided with this product  paring it all the way back to antivirus only service    and saw no improvement
positive:those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use
negtative:also  the lens cap design is flawed
negtative:you can  disable  some of the individual components  but don t be fooled  they re still there and running
positive:it s also easy to empty out
positive:the documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the 11b router  i needed a lot of help from linksys technical assistance to set that one up
positive:technology wise  i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great         i love this phone
positive:i would put the hitachi up with the best
positive:it has all the features one would need in a cellphone
positive:i d say that this camera is perfect
negtative:eax equalizer accentuates diminished quality of mp3 files
positive:i ve had it for about a week now and have to say it s one of the best purchases i ve ever made
positive:the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there
positive:the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks   when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation  a slightly audible click   if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n t even notice the click
positive:each battery lasts about 1011 hours
negtative:the only complaint i have is that the 14  collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 14  bits
negtative:the only problem i have with the buttons is that the power button and printshare button don t have a nice click
positive:i like the size and shape
positive:the first thing i did was upgrade the firmware to the version required for wmp10  it syncs flawlessly with media player and transfers are fast
negtative:on several different occasions it has displayed  no disc  with a disc inside
positive:all the features are incredibly intuitive  even for a novice like me
positive:the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night  but dim enough so it does n t blind you when you stare too long
negtative:the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the hohum software that comes with the system  and the traveling case it comes with
negtative:4  the camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away
positive:simply  the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point
positive:however  setting up using the quick start instructions was a breeze
positive:being a very economical person  i appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system i never did like the prospect of buying special diaper genie refills
negtative:both of the problem dvd s would repeatedly freeze during playback  while the counter on the player kept going
negtative:only one disk played through to completion successfully
negtative:my daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor
positive:the fit and finish of the product is firstrate
negtative:speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifices the battery life
positive:overall  i am very pleased with it
negtative:the program brings more problems than a virus  albeit not as major problems  just not what you expect for 70 bucks
negtative:video recording is limited at just 9 seconds
positive:the nokia 6600 is a great phone  good games  good camera
positive:i can t smell anything  and believe me  this is quite something with my baby
positive:the games are decent  but u only get 2 to start off with
positive:the ss body is wonderful  feels highquality
positive:i still have my s70 because i like the wider lens sometimes  but in general  if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package  the sd500 is the only one you should buy
positive:this is my second digital camera  but i m much more impressed with the canon s100 digital elph than i ever was with my kodak dc240
positive:i work on word  explorer  netscape  acrobat reader  photoshop at same time  meaning using a lot of memory   but still dont see a problem with computer  getting slow or crashing
positive:the camera is a dream to operate in auto mode  but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority  shutter priority  and manual modes
positive:this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in
negtative:it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter
positive:1  the phone has the best keypad any nokia phone has to offer
positive:not only is it functional and runs super smooth  fast  but it is also eye candy
negtative:apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy
positive:in fact  people who have been present while i changed my almost 3 month old son s diaper have been amazed at how the very potent  smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once i dispose of the diaper in the diaper champ
positive:linksys quality and tech support have been outstanding
negtative:it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button
positive:the sound is incredible   very clean  very wide dynamic range of bass  midas and highs  and can be very loud if i turn it up full blast
positive:the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software  with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth
positive:in addition it is very easy to setup
negtative:this version of internet security 2004  is beyond hope
positive:there is no odor and extremely easy to use
negtative:gets stinky after a few months  the seal on the piston doesn t seal anymore
positive:in auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera
positive:2  nice features  like web browser  camera  video recorder  speaker phone  very usefully   clear voice reception
positive:this camera has canon s great calorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get
positive:well linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry
negtative:the user support service isn t too great either
positive:they are razor sharp  the color balance is perfect  and the focus is great
negtative:i dont use the belt clip cz it fails to hold the player securely  design problem
positive:the photostitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots
negtative:there is also no voice recording  something most if not all mp3 players have that the ipod doesn t
positive:on the contrary  i m quite pleased with my upgrade
positive:battery nonissue
positive:i am very pleased so far
positive:there is no odor and it is very easy to use
negtative:i purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of nokia phones available
positive:you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n t make that big of a disturbance
negtative:software  music match jukebox is n t the greatest  the search function is n t fast even when accessing it with the hot key shortcut
positive:it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime
negtative:made the camera totally inoperable
positive:many of these programs are shareware  some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks
positive:the 4g ipod costs the same as this 5g zen micro
positive:tmobile is trying very hard  and again  they do have pretty good csr s
positive:one good thing  it is 40 gb of disk space  well  it is 38 gb in reality
positive:its fastforward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had
negtative:the instructions that come with it do n t explain how to make things simple
positive:6600 looks and feels nice
positive:good quality video
positive:creative has excellent music software  a very responsive tech support group  they are quick on firmware updates  and make them publicly available   and usually a good array of accessories
positive:great price
positive:user interface  the software is simple and straight forward
positive:all and all  i am extremely pleased with this camera
positive:nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception
negtative:if you think you are saving 40 getting the hitachi  you are right  and you are also getting a router worth 40 less than a makita
positive:the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry
negtative:2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations
positive:seems to work great
negtative:the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n t notice after first day
positive:i love the performance and features of this router
positive:the ipod is a very nice product  which given reasonable care  should give a lot of service
positive:the handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving
positive:it s cheaper  holds more songs and is smaller
positive:can t beat carrying 500cd collection with me wherever i go
positive:i am so pleased with this product
positive:i can t write enough positive things about this great little camera
negtative:but this doesn t make up for it s innumerable other shortcomings  the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with liveupdate
negtative:it would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die
positive:i also love that you can flip the device with one hand
positive:the interface has a sassier flair and the bluelit trimming is an added bonus
negtative:after several years of torture in the hands of att customer service i am delighted to drop them  and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 familyphones from att to tmobile
positive:however after purchasing a 20 gb ipod it s clear to see the superiority
positive:i did like the heft of the machine
positive:the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the ipod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay  300 for this great player
negtative:there is no fm tuner  while there is no fm tuner on the creative zen  on the micro version of the zen there is a tuner   the iriver h1020gb  the rio karma  and the audio x5 have fm tuners
positive:the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight
negtative:also  the fit and finish could be better although this doesn t detract from performance
positive:longer battery life  greater accessibility to online music services  and pc compatibility are the sensibilities
positive:all of this said as it s on it s way back to amazon  the one song it did include provided far better sound than the ipod
positive:it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse
negtative:you can see the lens barrel in the viewfinder
positive:but canon never fails to amaze
positive:night mode is clear as day
negtative:i am annoyed that the player s not automatically recognized as a hard drive
negtative:two  the single wrench just doesn t work well
negtative:the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap  it is not very snug and can come off too easily  and the lens itself  it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd
positive:i never get dropped calls
negtative:i d give it 5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes
positive:the zen micro is smaller than it looks in pictures  and feels very solid
negtative:one more thing  the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible
negtative:the plunge action isn t smooth unless you make it so
negtative:while i was trying to play half life 2 it started popping up with  alerts  every twenty seconds  literally   warning me my antivirus protection was off
negtative:then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all
positive:this one is full of features  has bluetooth
positive:overall  i m giving this 5 stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over  but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack  hissing  or scroll wheel problems show up with me too
positive:this is an excellent router for the price
positive:the file rippingtransfering software that comes with the player is easy to use
negtative:the headphone jack seems to be a major problem
negtative:unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed
negtative:this thing is trash
negtative:one complaint    the screen is too easily scratched
negtative:we resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the diaper champ for wet diapers only
negtative:it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do
positive:even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity
positive:the powershot g3 is a great camera
positive:i have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds  no big deal
negtative:no way to contact their customer service
positive:the ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from jobs and company
positive:i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it
positive:takes excellent photos
negtative:only one complaint about the speakerphone  you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone  not while it is ringing
negtative:the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on
positive:update  march 2005   my son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now  but the diaper champ hung in there till the very end  easy to use  no problems with odors  and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby
positive:amazon is awesome
negtative:unfortunately  linksys does not write the best documentation
positive:the optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom
negtative:the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line
negtative:i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it  it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio  but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment
positive:the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly
negtative:i was some what sceptically when i seen the price deference between the other makers of comparable hp
positive:for the zen creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out  well presented and easy to open and put back together
negtative:the grain was terrible
negtative:3  with mediasource being so easy  i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software
negtative:like most soho routers  it has nearly nonexistant logging
positive:i find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy
negtative:no in box accessories  an arm strap  belt strap  case  or anything would be nice  but nope    moveable parts  this makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th   with moveable parts  its easy to damage an ipod at a gym  so this is for more casual listeners   note the ipod mini doesn t have moveable parts and is made of titanium
positive:i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly  but there s no difference in working with the files
positive:it is small
negtative:cranking the master volume level up past the mark of the bar only leads to distortion and compromised sound quality
negtative:looks and durability  i realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface
positive:i have had no problems with the phone
positive:feature for feature  i find it a very sweet little player   equipped with a higher end headphone system  between this and th larger zen hardly use my home stereo system anymore
negtative:the adjustment knob seemed ok  but when lowering the router  i have to practically pull it down while turning the knob
positive:while going for a cellphone  i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones
positive:the battery life last es 12 hours  and charges quickly   as mentioned above  the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours  not too long at all    once you ve downloaded your music  you can access the tracks by artist  genre  album  composer  this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist  e  g  covers of songs   etc
positive:speakerphone  loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch
positive:the sound quality is very good
negtative:unfortunately  the touchpad issues nonintuitive and poor instruction guide killed it
positive:then sorting the files is easy as pie
positive:not counting the time i spent editing the songs  i suppose i should ve done it anyway on my pc  the transfer was pretty painless
positive:norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from
negtative:this has happened with several different dvd s and occasionally if we keep trying something  it will work when it did not work one time before
negtative:also  diapers and wipes get stuck in the grove below the piston
positive:the battery life is amazing
positive:because it can help a soso photographer take spectacular photos
positive:the phone has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display  long rundown time and a good software suite
positive:while they all seem to have their own positives and negatives  i picked the zen micro over the ipod mini  because i am not an apple person  never has been  i wanted something that is fully compatible with windows media player
negtative:it has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working
negtative:you ll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once
positive:this camera is worth every penny  and i highly recommend it
positive:the new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process
negtative:as one other reviewer pointed out  it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the  plunger  to get the diapers in the pail  even though upon inspection the bag doesn t really look full
positive:the hard case they give with it must work well
positive:upon opening the box i was confronted with this small cute little mp3 player
negtative:the os is ab it confusing at 1st  but within a few days you will pass this learning curve
positive:i didn t have any major problems installing this software
positive:i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement
negtative:i am bored with the silver look
negtative:do n t buy this player
positive:this year  it seems that i choose my timing perfectly  having discovered the awesome device that is the zen micro
positive:tough as nails
negtative:imagine my disappointment  though  when the zen micro proved able to play only the megastrongest fm signals in my area
negtative:difficult navigation  i wo n t necessarily say  difficult   but i do n t enjoy the scroll wheel to navigate
positive:5 excelent software package
positive:it has many great features and very few bad ones
negtative:operation  it s like bmw s idrive  it does it s job  but has the most unintuitive  overlylayered interface
negtative:i ve have many nokia s and while this is the best for features  it s the worst as a phone
positive:the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain
negtative:i can not find a carrier for this phone i like  end up just tossing it in my purse
positive:so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance  also anyone who wants a hard drive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing
negtative:although the sd500 takes great quality photos  the sensitivity of the lcd compromises the quality overall
positive:overall an excellent phone
positive:the latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of the states but still operates in many countries  excluding new zealand and australia
negtative:the instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the rp ms of the speed settings were mentioned
positive:solid  squeakfree  large screen
negtative:the front cover  which you remove to take out the battery  feels flimsy but when snapped on  the device still feels pretty solid
positive:i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots
negtative:you must keep double checking depths
positive:this is a good deal for music and data storage
positive:its sleek design  large memory capacity  compatibility with itunes  and ease of use makes this one of the best portable digital listening devices on the market
positive:i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to maneuver through the menus quickly
positive:very fast powerup and great speed when taking multiple pictures
positive:canon s optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better
positive:i have been very impressed with my purchase of the sd500 i bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it
negtative:this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of   and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues
negtative:i haven t seen any problems yet  but if you don t like to tinker a bit  this player can be a little challenging to set up
positive:if you are using linux  and you want to use gprs to connect to the net  i suggest this phone along with a belkin usb bluetooth adapter
positive:the ease of use of the ipod is a major attribute
positive:now he res the stuff you should know starting with the good things  the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect  fast as hell in music transfer  controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button  great sound and ive heard many mp3 players  a ton of different equalizer type deals on here
negtative:because the  engineers  at creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack
positive:nice things about the m12v   in a table  the powerful 3 14 hp motor is great  soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on  continuously variable speed control  amazon s price
negtative:the scroll button is sort of annoying to push  a nice button would be nicer but eh  not a big deal
positive:there is no comparison  the champ is easy and smell free  the genie was difficult to use one handed  which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad  and there was a def finite odor emanating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn t any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ
positive:i gave the zen 5 stars because it s excellent for the class that it is in and it s not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class
positive:i noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too
negtative:we ve purchased 3 universal remotes so farall claiming to work  apex  dvd players and none worked
positive:you can manage your profile  change the contrast of backlight  make different type of display  either list or tabbed
negtative:remote buttons are small and closely spaced  especially with the menu buttons
negtative:if someone asked me flat out  i d say to go woth something else
negtative:the support has been less than impressive  considering the cost
negtative:my first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful
positive:the manual is excellent
positive:this is a great diaper pail
negtative:2  phone is awfully slow
positive:antispam is good
positive:upside  this one  like most nokias  receives a consistently strong signal  i ve tried some samsung and sony ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front
negtative:unfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type
positive:i bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it  or have already bought it  it s size
positive:nokia does not disappoint in this model
negtative:the box included a little polyester  pullstring bag   yes  you read right a bag  something a boy would carry ten marbles in  and tries to pass it off as the case
positive:transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2  0
positive:this has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve
positive:anything this phone does  it does perfectly
positive:i will also say that setting up the email account was very simple and straightforward  although you do need an external smut server to use
negtative:secondly  in addition to the lag each time you give a command  it s just not that easily use able on the go
positive:the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod  however it compromises a bit of the unit s size in doing so
positive:there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture  zoom etc
positive:the storage capacity is great for me
positive:i am really impressed by this dvd player
positive:i have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright
positive:having used it for more than a month  i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos
positive:the card basically installed itself and the  install wizard  on the cd that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer  with the 54g card  and also a second computer in my house  with an 11b card
negtative:still  that s enough time that i m still satisfied  if a bit grouchy with creative s over hyped promises
positive:the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine
positive:the diaper champ couldn t be easier to use
negtative:the player itself has all sorts of problems
positive:i have ripped over 100 songs from my cd collection and it was so easy and fast  and they all sound great
negtative:in addition  i do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours  and it can take four hours for a full charge
positive:my favorite features  although there are many  are the speaker phone  the radio and the infrared
negtative:the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for tmobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have
positive:actually  the creative zen micro solves all that
positive:i have been impressed with the power of the hitachi m12v
positive:10  multiple play modes  tracks in order of album  shuffle  etc   is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter
negtative:the player usually plays dvd s  but has occasional problems such as  1  not recognizing a dvd 2  stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3  not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd
positive:this camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation
positive:one of my favorite features about the player is its ability to sync to windows media player
positive:basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n t used
positive:sound  excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice  check cons  it also doubles as a radio  which is a nice feature when you are bored
negtative:i will say that the os that the phone runs does have a few issues
positive:replaceable battery
negtative:when taking pictures of people  however  it shows every flaw in the subject s skin
positive:so easy to set up  had some problems with my archos
negtative:but it wouldn t let me turn the av protection back on and it wouldn t stop with the alerts
positive:this router has soft start and runs smooth and true
positive:i think it s great
positive:like it s predecessor  the quickly revised nx  this player boasts a decent size and weight  a relativelyintuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags  and excellent sound  widely known to be better than ipod  not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business
positive:i am very pleased with it so far
positive:you have the option to have the flash automatic or off
negtative:who wants to pay 30 to discuss a defect in a product that just cost 95    i also bought the backup cd
positive:i love the continuous shot mode  which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession  great for action shots
negtative:solid food poop is very stinky and this diaper pail doesn t really contain the smell
positive:i am very pleased with the apex ad2600  it plays just about anything you put in the drawer
positive:it looks very cool  and seems quite small to me and very light
positive:it hasnt gone below the second notch  i charge mine whenever i m at home and not using it   so the battery life seems fine  so far
positive:nokia and tmobile really teamed up well on this baby
positive:so much packed in a small case and very affordable
negtative:very bad quality
positive:i have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode  while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera  its quality easily surpasses that of my old hi8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe  max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card
positive:the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad
negtative:the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select  you have to push straight in or it sticks
positive:it s very quiet for a universal motordriven tool  and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great
positive:excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jv players
positive:i compared this to a lot of other cameras  believe me  it s value for money
negtative:even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little  resulting in a noisy startup
negtative:what is added in functionality  battery replacement  detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off
positive:1  record around 1 hour of video with phillips camcorder pro
positive:i just replaced my old linksys router with this one  turned everything on in the right order  and it was up and running with no problems
positive:why bother when it works perfectly with media player 10
negtative:unit took forever since the beginning to recognize and play discs
positive:the battery is replaceable  a real plus  and there is a leather case  another real plus
positive:i m not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its liion battery  the better firmware  or a combination of both factors
positive:sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning  and the evening
positive:the diaper champ is the best
positive:i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player
positive:reviews for sound quality are generally  but not universally  positive
positive:the radio works excellent in my area  i m not sure everywhere else
negtative:output went black and white only via both svideo and composite connections  and with no vhold
positive:while i would like to give it 3  5 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it
positive:outside of the tmobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto att wireless and various other services where the tmobile service was unavailable
negtative:this product sucks  the customer service from apex sucks
positive:it also holds a lot more diapers
negtative:my only significant complaint is sound quality
positive:the speed is the same as dali up  where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up
positive:the good  1  large lcd screen  colorful display  good resolution
positive:8  connected the phone to my tablet pc and now can access company von at 56k speed via bluetooth
negtative:one beef is the scroll  it does n t work as well as i d like
negtative:the day finally arrived when i was sure i d leave sprint
positive:white earbuds  i replaced those with some shire headphones  big difference   a case  a stand  a clip  which doesn t really work   and a nice little zen micro bag
negtative:it would either not play the song at all  or skip wildly  no matter that the unit was resting on my desk
positive:overall  i ve been very impressed with the player
positive:the fact that has an opensource firmware makes it a great option in my opinion
positive:i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options  shutter priority  aperture priority  light metering adjustments  etc   but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear
positive:i ve had this player for more than 4 months and i m very happy with it
negtative:included creative software is pretty poor
negtative:after a week i tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn t do anything but turn on my player
negtative:the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player  but not the folder name
positive:the build quality feels solid  it does n t shake or whine while playing discs  and the picture and sound is top notch  both dots and dd5  1 sound good
positive:its compact and has rounded edges
positive:i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it
positive:whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers  this is the truly the only diaper pail to get
positive:all you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network
positive:the sd500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed
positive:the instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep
negtative:user s guide doesn t cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website
negtative:you even can not navigate by genre  artist  album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre  no other division
positive:downloads are a snap and quick
negtative:the interface took a little getting used to
negtative:relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots
negtative:3  mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws
positive:i have the black one and adore it
negtative:even though i have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer
negtative:i replaced it with a router raiser and it works much better
positive:i love this product
negtative:button sensitivity  even reduced to the lowest sensitivity setting  the buttons are far two sensitive  really takes some getting use to  and even then  it is still too sensitive
positive:i have been absolutely  completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities
positive:don t care about sunlight  it s tft
positive:i want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason
negtative:it has a few inconveniences  one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd
positive:it s worth it
positive:you actually can talk to a real person for support in under an hour
positive:i ve been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it s advertised
negtative:it feels like i m back to the days of 56k dialup internet service  even though i m running a dell 2ghz pentium 4 with 256mb memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year
negtative:i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed
negtative:if there were any complaints i have  they are marginal  but one is apples  proprietary setup for music files  their incompatibility with other music services  i  e  napster  is down right wrong
negtative:not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it
positive:simple to use and hook up
positive:it s easy to use  just a flip of the lid  and the diaper is gone
positive:i thought i d have to buy a set of headphones to use with it  but the included earbuds work quite well
positive:while i had the phone  the positive features were  good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece
positive:i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vb files which i created with smart ripper
positive:overall  it ll make my move that much easier knowing i don t have to worry about connectivity
negtative:i knew this before hand  and it is not that bad  there is no tiff format
positive:the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides
positive:in general it is easy to use and well laid out
positive:the earbud headphones are really nice
negtative:first thing i noticed was that the creative wasn t well made
positive:i ve had no problems w this phone
positive:placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect
positive:at first i had a problem with some smell  then i realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in  then there is no smell at all
negtative:it could be a little bit bigger  but it s easy to get used to
positive:as far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price remember this router is the same one that was released right when the g standard was introduced to the market
negtative:what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds
positive:i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it
positive:battery life is very good  i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so
negtative:so i took out the battery and put it back in again  only to find that it would not work
positive:another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load  wav sounds as ringers
positive:great screen and great sound
positive:it plays everything  even vcd s
positive:i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time
positive:this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you ll use all the time
negtative:stay away from this junk
positive:so far i have used all of the abovementioned features  and find them well designed  and easy to understand
negtative:my old sony ericsson t610 has this feature
positive:so far  3 weeks   we ve had no problems with the diaper champ at all
positive:i actually purchased two phones recently  this one at the new blackberry phone   and this one is far superior  imho
positive:loved the slim design
positive:considering the price and specs  this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player
positive:all reviews i ve seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukebox ed  ipod  archos  dell  samsung
negtative:5  this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control
positive:it s slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features
positive:i love the diaper champ  it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn t cost an arm and a leg for refills
negtative:you can upgrade but then there s a certain level of trouble involved
negtative:feedback on creative s product support is universally poor   this is not limited to the zen  it applies to all the company s products
positive:this is a great product  and canon has done an excellent job
positive:setup is totally breeze and linksys s web site is pretty easy to navigate
positive:sound  exceptional  though i can t really compare it to the ipod
positive:original review december 2004 i m sorry to read about other people having problems with their zen micro  but mine has worked great
positive:on top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable  it is just a plunge router that works really well
positive:the canon computer software used to download  sort  upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use
positive:after using it for about a month  i can state unequivocally that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck
negtative:also  the battery s aren t user replaceable
positive:this phone has many other features  ir    just to name one  the features above i view as the most beneficial
negtative:fm receiver  it has none
positive:give each friend a different ringtone
positive:overall  small  sounds great  and less expensive than apple s overpriced ipod
positive:it has great battery life  fm radio  excellent signal  hands free speakerphone  which i have to say is probably my favorite function  and downloadable java apps
positive:many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it s easy to use and effective
positive:their website had a download that helped remove those  although i had to manually remove a good number of files from the  programs  directory
positive:it is the most bangforthebuck out there
positive:i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song  playlist etc fast enough
positive:this is a very light phone  a little less than 3 oz  with long battery life  not as long as the new polymer technology
positive:this phone has a very cool and useful feature  the speakerphone
positive:but overall this is a good camera with a  really good  picture clarity   an exceptional closeup shooting capability
negtative:00 good though  and the zen does have a few drawbacks
positive:on the positive side  the sound of the player is pretty good  once you have everything configured
positive:the power  low noise operation  and speed control makes up for the problems i have experienced
positive:feels solid in hand
negtative:namely  it wouldnt sync
positive:i got it working fast enough
positive:just a little overview  powershot g3 is the flagship of canon s powershot series and its an slrlike camera  its 4 megapixel and  almost  full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance
negtative:this simple nuance was too much for nokia  and they still refuse to acknowledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free
positive:my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price  i found both
negtative:the wizard is particularly sinister
negtative:however  the battery life isn t as good as i would like
positive:speakerphone
positive:you can also slow a song down  speed it up  which is cool too
positive:the signal to noise ratio  the ratio of detectable  useful data to unusable garbage in  say  a radio wave   a larger stn ratio is better  is nice and high at 98 decibels  and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods
positive:the image quality is excellent
positive:when i opened the box  i was shocked by the size of this thing    it s tiny
positive:the clarity is unbelievable  which means you can cram almost the full 2  5
positive:i have n t messed with the firmware at all  the player worked perfect for me right out of the box
negtative:the controls are somewhat harder to use  and there are some oddities about the software tagging system  but most people can live with this
positive:my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems
positive:the software that comes with the digital elph is very nice and intuitive
positive:it is slow to initially start up  but once it s turned on  i ve never had any complaints about the speed
positive:i am absolutely in awe of this camera  canon put enormous quality into the g3
negtative:ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings  there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring
positive:its not a perfect system but its a very good one
negtative:the back of the ipod is in a chrome finish  and this surface is prone to scratches
negtative:ultimately you will learn just how bad nokia is  and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved
positive:i simply love this feature
positive:i can use it as a modem for my computer  connect with clients and friends  the possibilities are endless
positive:this is a really great buy  for yourself or as a shower gift
positive:my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money
negtative:after 10 years  i now downloaded mccaffee s product after calling their support     they answered quickly  and for free  and were very helpful
positive:compared to musicmatch  the software has a better filing system and easier to use
positive:the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it s class
positive:five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums
positive:7 360 panoramic pictures are a very big deal
positive:before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one  and now that i have it i could n t be happier and i m convinced it s the best one out there
negtative:if you have no previous version of nortron security on your system  or nortron antivirus  the installation will go fine  otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up   the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation  even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly
positive:i really have no complaints over this unit
positive:the software is very easy to use  and the transfer is super fast
negtative:after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd s are dirty
negtative:the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating
positive:the bass treble the sound detail is aw some
negtative:my friend has an ipod  and although the sound quality probably won t meet most audiophile standards  the product itself is better than anything creative has made
positive:my op ion is concentrate on what you need now  this product has excellent range  holds a teddy connection  ha sent even drooped one and i have it for more than a month now
positive:battery life is exceptional  lasting longer than the 810 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market
positive:the sound is very nice
negtative:apple closed their island to anything that resembled microsoft  and clearly let napster know it could not use their products with napster s services
positive:software is easy to use  although red hat software is better  but costs money
positive:overall  the micro is a solid device and i haven t fell into a problem with it yet knocks on wood
positive:i find this to be a great feature
negtative:the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display
positive:the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit
positive:i must add to the dismaydelight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held
negtative:respectable  solid  but not aweinspiring
positive:4  the build is just right
negtative:having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying
negtative:new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays
positive:it s size also makes it ideal for travel
negtative:i m an advocate of nokia  but this phone and the following models  7610   are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much underengineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone
positive:canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out
positive:it s a very intuitive program
positive:6  play game boy color games on it with go boy
positive:this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cmdr  cadre  dvd  dvd  and of course plays dvd movies from uk  i love the giff  progressive scan feature
negtative:i m convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed  and will not hold up to normal use
positive:plus  the fact that it used regular trash bags is great
positive:it was no problem for me to use their software
negtative:also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls
positive:i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i ve used before
positive:everything i wanted   the apple ipod has become one of the most soughtafter electronic gadgets  and for good reason
negtative:scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models
positive:the touchpad is great once you get used to it  and i much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels  as on the dell dj for example
positive:nice little phone    light compact
positive:and it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained  which the diaper genie never did
positive:the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good
positive:and best of all  no wasting money on special refill bags  this takes ordinary garbage bags
positive:the ipod is the best thing i have ever used
positive:the color screen is a plus  as are the polyphonic ringtones
positive:i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files   this gives an average of around 6065 mb per cd  good for about 900 cds in the  57  000 mb of free memory available to me
positive:the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited
positive:it s easy to transfer  preview  and organize files
positive:n6600 supports midi  wav  arm  mp3 etc
positive:i am quite happy with the camera
positive:update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it
positive:i ve had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use
negtative:most of us just want to plug and play  not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options    like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing
positive:for me  it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a highquality result
positive:other than the fact that one can t delete a file directly from the ipod  the interface is excellent and mindnumbingly simple to use
positive:finding all the albums  songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have 20 gig  well 18 gig  worth of music
negtative:after attempting to navigate the clumsy touchpad system  i could not get the unit to download my wma files
positive:great features
positive:i ve got a buddy who s trying to offload his almost new 300 systematic because he saw what this router can do
positive:they are sensitive and accurate  perhaps too accurate  it senses through tshirt cloth  but the touchpad can be locked   but easy to clean  unlike buttons
positive:the ones i ve kept  porter cables  dew alts  bosch  and this hitachi  have proven their worth over the years  however  when i need a real workhorse  i grab this router
positive:it works great  i am usually at the full 54 mbps  although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is
positive:what a kick butt mp3 machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source  instead of paying for them two or three times  then get the creative zen ipod killer  kiss my ass itunes
negtative:the only other problem was that security for the wireless connection
positive:about the product  the zen micro is a sleek  stylish device that caters not just to  hip  youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life  size  or the  awkward  factor
positive:2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use
negtative:during install  nis would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so
negtative:one downside  as of this writing  tmobile has n t updated their tzone system to fully support the 6610
positive:anyway  my wife got this for me for my birthday and i love the thing
negtative:the only drawbacks i ve encountered are  1 indoor shots from a distance  8ft lack contrast and color  but i ve found this to be a problem with all cameras with builtin flashes that i ve used even on a nikon slr
positive:this camera is bulletproof
negtative:about the only legitimate criticism from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder
negtative:after a recent update  i can no longer open more then 1 browser window
positive:9  wakeup feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time
negtative:the remote is a little hard to understand
positive:even with these shortcomings  i still think it is the best digital camera available under  1200
positive:the earbuds that come with it are n t that bad
positive:ok  score 7  0 oh yes  the newest color of this phone is quite cool
positive:3  4x zoom is nice
positive:all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well
positive:it sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all  and we live in the damp and humid south  where odors of all kinds are generally rife
positive:all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved
negtative:anyhow some demerits of this phone  the phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most nokia variants
negtative:i am glad that i do not work for norton
negtative:you hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of seconds to bring up the menu
positive:this is the best purchase i ve made in a very long time
negtative:there isn t much features on the ipod at all  except games
negtative:a lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for napster to go   the firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it
negtative:the depth adjustment was sloppy
positive:we hardly ever have to charge them  get great reception  live in chicago   and the customization and applications are awesome
positive:in my table the m12v has been a real champ
positive:we really enjoyed shooting with the canon powershot sd500
positive:the size of the camera is perfect
negtative:the fm radio s reception isn t spectacular  but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area
positive:this is an excellent player  especially for the price  with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod
negtative:we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working
positive:the scroll wheel is better than the ipod s as well  in that you do n t risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly  just a small nudge of the finger and you re there
positive:i m sure i don t use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers  but i really like it
negtative:they will not respond to my emails  promised turnaround time is 24 hours  and the phone line is constantly busy
negtative:i purchased a jukebox  it got fried while being recharged  they asked for  20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for reaping the damned thing
positive:when i turned the phone on  the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is
positive:the software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the creative software  windows media player 10  or simply windows explorer to move music back and forth between your zen touch
positive:this phone won me over  and a big seller was the size   it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out
positive:it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder  but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree earpiece which is included
negtative:the zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet
negtative:i thought given all the  10  reviews about this camera that i would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey
positive:other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely won t disappoint any already established nokia phone fans
positive:transferring music is a breeze  i don t subscribe to music services  but as mentioned on other reviews  micro allows you to subscribe to services other than itunes
positive:it is a very amazing product
negtative:sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches
negtative:i dont especially like how music files are unstructured   basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization  like you might have in windows explorer folders and sub folders
positive:the menu is easy to use and understand
negtative:to address two previous somewhat negative reviews   1  yes  the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder   however  the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder
positive:the rate plans are also very good  at least for me
positive:the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough
positive:the product i rate five stars
positive:i don t believe this camera is still available  but if you can find one  you might like to get it
negtative:it still smelled
negtative:it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation
positive:other mp3 players won t give you the sonic clarity of the zen at this compression level  so i imagine they won t at lower ones  either
positive:from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity  to the downloadable polygraphic meg atones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone
negtative:first  the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds
positive:even with the waterproof housing it is small
positive:my first impression was positive
negtative:what i dont like  nothing much except headphones  belt clip design
positive:i did n t think i would find this quality and ease of use for under  1500  i m thrilled with my purchase
negtative:the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well
positive:in summary  i love this camera and would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range
positive:the hitachi m12v is a dream to work with  smooth starts  adjustable speeds  microadjustable depth  and plenty of power to spare
positive:i got it to use with the new 5permonth service from yahoo  music unlimited   and despite the above issues  i love it
positive:1  the champ is easy to use
positive:the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product
positive:it s very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout  and it has a great feature set
positive:i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality andor lots of features you would find in a pda
positive:i love that you don t have to purchase expensive refills
negtative:on the plus side it s packed with features  including bluetooth that works fine  it s really a tiny computer that is also a phone    and that s the negative
negtative:among its weak points is the mmc slot location and a bit vague design
negtative:you re going to need to buy new headphones  the stock ones suck
negtative:but my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design
positive:it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep
positive:its ability to record radio is useful as well  but would have been more so if it could be preset
positive:friends told me that the diaper genie did not work very well  so bought the diaper champ based on online reviews and i have been happy with it
negtative:the ms scandisk would appear due to manual shutdown and would only scan to the 2nd bar  over and over  up to 1 hr  i then shut it down and used go back
negtative:5  lack of good accessories  this is more of an oversight of creative s marketing
positive:i ve been incredibly happy with this camera
positive:ease of usedesign  the ipod is a very easy to use mp3 player  and if you can t figure this out  you shouldn t even own one
positive:this is overall the best point and shoot camera i ve used
positive:you can take pic of your friends and the picture will pop up when they call
positive:i didnt get ipod because i dont especially like itunes  no music i want  but thats just me  and the creative product was cheaper   and i needed to be able to use wma files
positive:this camera is so easy to use
positive:take quick pictures with excelent resolution
positive:update i knew that i loved the champ  and using the diaper genie at a friend s house really reinforced that
negtative:after two weeks the picture kept freezing
negtative:i had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the norton firewall vs  the windows firewall  and waited 45 minutes to speak with a tech support representative because i did not have a  customer priority id number
positive:if you re looking for a 3hp plunge router  the hitachi m12v is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget
positive:unlike other reviewers  i like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table
negtative:kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward  but i can deal with that
positive:yes  the 1800 number probably redirected me to someone in india  but the guy was easy to understand  and he helped solve the problem
negtative:it seemed as if we were emoting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless
positive:i have n t had time to really push this player to the limit  but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory  as should be expected from creative labs
positive:dependability  i ve seen no glitches
positive:the flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent
positive:4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience   cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera  3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon s quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worth wile at the price
positive:it is a bit difficult to get the unit open  the advice to take it slowly is sound   but now that our son is walking and exploring  i consider this a positive attribute
positive:i like some local stations  stern  and npr  and so the radio seemed like a great option
negtative:the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on  60 percent of the time  it sis  shutting down  which means i have to turn off  and turn it on again  which is not to my likings
positive:even at the  normal  setting  a 8x10 print   shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels  you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a  digital
positive:the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone  saved me hours of reentering my numbers
negtative:their site offers no live help at all
negtative:our norton internetav 2004 was terrible right from the get go  so i d think that if steelworks is ok now  it should remain ok
negtative:and the body  construction in general has quite a bit of plastic  a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330
positive:while i have not had the  privilege   as many call it  of owning an ipod  based on the experience of friends who have had some misfortune with their ipod  and subsequently purchased the zen touch or zen micro   i can pretty much rest assured that my decision to purchase the zen micro was one of the more informed ones
positive:this is really a nice diaper pail
negtative:i ve also had the nomad zen lockup several times
positive:so the pretty solid router all around good for the money here s the link to firmware updates http  www  suavest  comforum6  html
positive:with the automatic settings  i really have n t taken a bad picture yet
negtative:after using it for just a month  i could not play any dvd
negtative:the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap  is uncomfortable to use
negtative:the outlook syn ch only works for non recurring appointments  which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people
positive:as i said  i don t regret the purchase at all
negtative:when i got it home  i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n t there
positive:its stable  so a curious toddler can t easily tip it over
positive:excellent range of metering options as well
positive:it definitely keeps the smell out
positive:1  great audio quality overall
positive:this is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks
positive:it is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some porter cable models i tried
negtative:radio quality  weak reception
positive:i think the os and controls are very well thought out and although i ll admit i was a bit intimidated during my first few hours with the micro  the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so
positive:this is a wonderful camera
positive:i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size  speakerphone option  great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email
positive:i guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler
positive:the battery has a long life
negtative:now  the player s ear phone jack is not working  i have to send it away again
negtative:cons  difficult to open to change bagtwice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as i was pulling outleaving dirty diapers all over the floor
negtative:i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their online support site and their telephone line  but they wo n t answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy
positive:it gives great pictures  the controls are easy to use  the battery lasts forever on one single charge  the software is very userfriendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing
positive:overall  this router seems like a reasonably priced product th
positive:if you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times  then this is a great camera choice
negtative:what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software
positive:and the biggest plus is that you don t have to buy any expensive refills
positive:the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access  and it takes silent movies
negtative:main dial is not backlit
positive:sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference
positive:the digital zoom takes as good of pictures  as the optical zoom does
positive:i love this camera
positive:the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there
negtative:i could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days
positive:i have set up it s pda features with avaunt  com where you can download info from sites like weather  map quest mapsdirections into it  which is great
positive:with 40gb of storage i have about 7  500 songs on the player  everything music file i have is on there  with room for about 2  500 more
positive:having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific
positive:all in all suprisingly easy to use
negtative:i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2
positive:it has a classic design yet looks hip
positive:also if you want a device that does so much more than the ipod mini but is at the same price  this is the player for you
positive:i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him
positive:this camera is truely superb
positive:overall this tool is very well worth the price and i have no regrets about my purchase
negtative:it also has unproven battery life
positive:high quality video and pictures rock
positive:it s such a great camera   i think it really was worth the investment
positive:recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available
positive:overall build quality  good macrosresults  impressive videoquality  good pictures with flash  good colours  sharp results   excellent auto white balance
positive:and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play
positive:other than that this thing is great
positive:the zen serves as a backup device as well as a player
positive:have a great and easy to use bundled software
negtative:not plug  play   relies on id3   no fm or recording
negtative:little to no networking experience  just in case the automatic cd method has issues
positive:the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them
positive:wish i could give it 4 12 stars
negtative:when you look through the viewfinder  not the lcd  the bottom left corner of the picture  about 15   is blocked by the lens
negtative:all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once  but it has n t done it since
negtative:the menu pops up after 3 seconds the picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory
negtative:even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast
positive:i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine
negtative:i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n t do it
positive:the router has plenty of power for any type of bit or wood i need to cut  and the speed control knob is easy to get to
negtative:some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone  and it has rightfully gotten the nickname  the bar of soap  which  it really is
positive:the reception and sound quality are topnotch
negtative:i still like it a lot and am not changing it for another  but it is sort of stinky
positive:the battery is nice
negtative:the only way my pc internet works is if i open the firewall program configuration and manually refresh it
negtative:after telling the rep and his tech supervisor the problem the only answer was to uninstall the program  which i had already done
negtative:the faceplate  which pops out for the battery  pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so
positive:i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites
positive:the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone  which you will enjoy
negtative:the headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of  ear buds
negtative:the controls are hard to manipulate  especially in the dark
positive:all in all  it s a good router if you don t have the cash for a speed booster one
negtative:i would give it about 6 or 7 hours  although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles
positive:file transfers are fast  nearly a song per second via usb 2  0
negtative:however  the calls constantly drop in my area and i experience megastatic  to the point where i d have to dial numbers 67 times to get a clear line
negtative:it only read the dvds 10  of the time  otherwise i would get a no disc screen
negtative:all the camera s functionality is only available  or selectable  when the screen is functional
negtative:yes  there is a belt clip  but that doesn t hold the extra battery and usb cable
negtative:it sends discontinuous signals to tv  so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment
positive:i love the touchpaper controls
negtative:the new drivers on cannon s site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software
positive:works perfectly with my netgear wireless paramecia
positive:the height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy  but it works well and provides good accuracy
positive:they player s interface itself is also very easy to use
negtative:it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working
negtative:features  really  there aren t any features  unless you call the games a feature
positive:i do not need to repeat what s great about this phone
positive:the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot
positive:3  the nomad explorer  winxp style interface  works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support website states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player
negtative:4  buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging
positive:and it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old s30
positive:i thought the fm radio would not see much use with so many tracks available to me  but its great for tuning in to tv programs at the gym while on the treadmill  concerts and programs being simulcast  npr  and on and on
positive:it works great
negtative:well flash photos are never great  and there was still a lot of noise
positive:the player is great
negtative:the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well
positive:great phone  easy to use  excellent network  no regrets
negtative:again  the headphone jack on this thing is garbage
negtative:3  folders can not be created for the audio files
positive:the phone book is very userfriendly and the speakerphone is excellent
negtative:the firmware has bugs too  so download and install the latest firmware from linksys
negtative:it also does n t have voice activated dialing  big minus
positive:sound  this is where i love zen the most
negtative:it is a bit cumbersome  and i can t get to the songs i want as quickly
positive:if you need a wireless router     get it get it get it     works really good
positive:the display is awesome  you can see everything you want and read it clearly
negtative:i occasionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly  yes i have it in maximum desensitized mode
positive:apart from speed  the signal is consistent and works without interruptions  etc
positive:the package also comes with a usb cable  an ac adapter  a pair of headphones  they re okay until you get a better pair   a stand  and a microfiber pouch to carry your zen touch in
negtative:cons  no amfm radio tuner  something a large number of compete tors are doing
positive:it s so small and light  even with a spare battery  you really can take it anywhere
positive:and the video quality is amazing
negtative:the vibration is not top
negtative:sometimes the pictures are on the dark side  but i m able to fix that using the photoshop 6  0  adjust levels  function    not sure how a person would do that without photoshop  though
positive:i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far
positive:1  price  gb of storage
negtative:headphones suck  i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature
positive:if you ll only read the whole manual  you ll find out even more cool features and you ll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading
positive:no vibration
positive:2  take around 10  000 640x480 pictures
positive:the size is tiny  which i love
positive:for looks  well ipod is head and shoulders better  both the iriver and creative zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming ipod
negtative:my jpeg pictures are viewable  not so sharp and vivid  on my 27  screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17  monitor
negtative:unlike my 3 other mp3 players  this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks
positive:i highly recommend a nokia 6610
negtative:however  it has failed to deliver on quality
positive:this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones
positive:overall  a good buy for the price
positive:it takes great pictures
negtative:however  i am very disappointed with this product and with symantec
positive:well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket
negtative:they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it s been 2 weeks without a reply
positive:8 battery life is excellent
positive:purchased this router a few months back  no problems whatsoever
positive:in the hands of someone who does n t  it will yield good results on idiot program  auto mode
negtative:the  movies  last about 5 seconds
negtative:it wo n t play all of my movies
negtative:yeah  this program protects your computer all right  by locking you off the internet
negtative:while the software may not be as easy as itunes  it is not difficult to use by any stretch
positive:this is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers
positive:the zen lives up to the audio quality i love and expect
positive:the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car  very audible even with freeway noise
positive:the picture rs are amazing
negtative:i added a crank for those times when i need to make fine adjustments  but i seldom use it
negtative:but  i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment
negtative:the cutouts for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls  especially the scroll wheel
positive:i bought the player this week and i like it by far
negtative:the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot
positive:picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm
negtative:the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focuslocks  even in bright light   and the unsatisfactory light quality of the builtin flash
positive:if anyone is thinking of getting an ipod mini  forget it and go with this player
positive:the combination of the price  storage size  and player features makes this player the best on the market
negtative:no voice activated dialing  what were they thinking
positive:with eax on  you can modify your sound  with 4 different presets  which is pretty good  you can get different variations with it
positive:i just got an older 866 mhz system with 512 pc 133 ram and it also runs fine on that
positive:i have owned some kind of creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support
positive:advanced photo bugs will find more creative control than imaginable
positive:it did play a dvdr which was unplayable in my older philips machine
negtative:limitations   not a lot of original accessories like the ipod
positive:no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers
positive:i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets
negtative:next  the big reason not to buy any norton product  if there s a problem with it  norton charges 30 to even tell them about it
positive:i decided to save the   and opted for the zen xtra    and i was not disappointed
negtative:the creative software is awkward  difficult to use and just plain does n t load on some computers
positive:progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well
positive:its well made and user friendly
positive:compared to everything else in this category  this is most definately the best bang for the buck
positive:1 small
positive:i can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images  calender events  contacts and anything else
positive:and so far  i have been very  very happy with my zen micro
negtative:as of october  2004  these products are not working and i m ready to demand a refund from symantec
negtative:durability  not good  first problem  if you haven t seen the news recently  the ipods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months
positive:overall this is a slightly better than average phone
positive:easy enough to navigate through  although i d prefer a sturdier button besides the thumb wheel scroll  push button
positive:surfing the web on it is nice as well  i just wish there were more wap pages available
negtative:multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you d expect
negtative:the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i d have liked them to be
negtative:even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image
positive:this is the first phone i know of that has the large bright screen  infrared  bluetooth  usb connector and a speakerphone
positive:with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority  for high speed subjects   aperture priority  for focal length  or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality
negtative:nice machines  but i consider their quality pretty low now
negtative:however  it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all  dosn t work at all in the car  for example
positive:no skips  and it hasn t faltered once  despite your inevitable drop or two
positive:it has given me zero problems  and the more i use it  the better i become at taking advantage of its strengths
negtative:one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu
negtative:their customer  www  apex digital inc  com  service is very poor
positive:all the  cool  features of the mini  but with 20gb instead of 5
positive:with one of the most intuitive userinterfaces around  seamless bluetooth sync with microsoft outlook  support for thousands of applications for the symbian platform which this phone runs on  i own the ir remote  iq and a few others   the nokia 6600 is all of the above  one of the few phones from tmobile that can claim such a distinction
positive:i have owned this camera for a short time and would n t give it up for anything
negtative:transfering  i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1  1 or 2  0
negtative:the inside pics  can be a bit challenging  but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like  that are not focused perfectly  or need lighting adjustments  make this camera very simple and effective
positive:i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images
negtative:the adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with xp so you are forced to create your document then either print it from windows or export it to another application
negtative:i did it and it was worse the second time around    unbelievable
positive:setup in xp was instant and intuitive
negtative:i sent creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don t seem to even want to help
negtative:if you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged  they charge you roughly 105  50 per minute and blame you for  abusing  your ipod
negtative:once again it won t reinstall  even with online and email assistance from symantect technicians
positive:this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range  or like me  do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones
positive:owner s manual has substandard troubleshooting guide
positive:after installation  which was very simple     i downloaded any updated software from the creative website  before i downloaded any music
negtative:it took me three days  to the tune of neil young s song  piece of cr      to get this to work with the satellite hookup i was hired to connect this wireless network up to
negtative:they are not wow able good
negtative:very annoying
positive:a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories  as always
positive:that s a rare and valuable feature
positive:another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying
positive:huge storage space  even at 320kbs  you can store a ton of songs on this thing
positive:i got this for christmas  and it is a great gift
negtative:i built my own router table with a tilt up top  made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob  these two things make it easy to change out  raise or lower the bits
positive:sound quality  excellent  everything you would expect from this company
negtative:i hope you have a magnifying glass  because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny
positive:it is heavy enough to make it stable  but not too heavy to preclude hand use
negtative:2  music organization is based on id3  by genre  artist  album  etc   and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information
positive:i am extremely satisfied with this camera
positive:because this camera is beautiful
positive:i can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time  it is that simple
negtative:navigation system  the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs
negtative:this model does have the traditional key arrangement  it s just that they are really close to one another  and have unconventional shapes  so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands
positive:itunes  this is a lovehate relationship program   usually people with mac like this program than people with a pc  but depending on your computer expertise  this could be a difficult program to use  and it is required for an ipod
positive:i had a casio unit  which had given great service  and would have been happy to get another one  but was tempted by the ipod s sleek design  storage capacity  connection options  firewire and usb  and its integration with itunes
positive:1  i achieved my basic objective   my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more
positive:it s cute as anything and the glowing blue led looks super cool around the edges
negtative:too difficult to change genre  album  track information for large number of tracks
positive:i m not sure why all the bad reviews  my computer isn t especially slowed down and i have win 98
positive:they re easy to use
positive:if you want to work wirelessly  this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now
negtative:the instant setup button in the front of the router messes up the network it is better to configure the router manually
positive:overall  this player is awesome and i definately recommend it
negtative:it just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a preexisting router  mine does   without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hardwired pc or a wireless equipped pc
negtative:this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas
positive:the box is upstairs  and in the farthest room i get connected at 1118m speed  that is similar to the older 10m ethernet standard
negtative:you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight camera shake is a problem to contend with
negtative:long reboots due to norton taking forever to boot
positive:pros   excellent sound  even with the headphones that come out of the box  but it absolutely rocked with my bose quiet comfort 2 set
negtative:and man    i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player    because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title
positive:anted to rate the router higher than 1 star  due to its security  easy of use  etc
negtative:but i had to give you four because the service for my brandnew ipod was terribly slow
positive:you can do  so  much more with the pc suite  i  e  free ringtones from midi files  free graphics from any picture on your computer  and if you know how to program jame you can even make your own apps  games
positive:it also works just fine for international calls
positive:the sound is just fine
positive:it really is a great buy if you are loo kin at having just one modem but many computers around the house
positive:the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semipro  pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography
negtative:i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone
positive:i love this player
positive:i still need to read up on some of the security settings  etc to fully understand all that s up there  but bottomline is that the installation was like night and day compared to the speed boost router
negtative:the flash is very weak
positive:slicklooking design and improved interface
positive:if you bring up an album  but absolutely hate some of the tracks  the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order
positive:it works well with my vip adapter  which is also a linksys
positive:and we definitely prefer our champ
positive:norton s memory usage on systems with 512 mb is very low
positive:the main issue now is that this new zen micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily
negtative:creative  inc  the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box  then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on every single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices
positive:i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i m not too keen on www  ipods dirty secret  com
negtative:now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images  i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7
positive:i have no problem using itunes with the zen micro  in a makeshift sorta way
negtative:2  you still have to clean the thing
positive:audio formats  supports both mp3  wma    and yeah  wav too
negtative:the disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures  especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can
positive:the creative zen micro  at first glance  is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers
negtative:norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer
positive:in all fairness  customer reps are very nice  and they  most of them  try hard to answer your questions
negtative:the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical
negtative:even the instruction booklet is out of order
negtative:my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software
negtative:i can only hear the sound but no picture
positive:i ve owned this router for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it
positive:silverfish color really adds a special touch
positive:replacement battery is  50 compared to ipod s  150
positive:also  you have to use it with itunes  or they ll sue  dammit   but itunes is about as good as anything
positive:5  the price is right
positive:the camera is very easy to use  in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group
positive:if you use software correctly  put in all the id3 tags  you will get an awesome database collection  from which you can easily access your songs
positive:with the ipod  you can also store documents and contact files  from programs such as microsoft outlook  when it s connected to your pc as an external hard drive
negtative:sure it had all the features  but when i tried to shoot a girl s basketball game it just wan t up to the task
negtative:the included headphones suck  so get your own
negtative:their network coverage is very sporadic  and the network always seems overloaded  resulting in very unpleasant calling experience
positive:flawless
positive:the wrt54g offers excellent security features and much more  and easier  configuration menu that i didn t even need a manual to setup correctly
positive:batteries last longer too
positive:if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder  i highly recommend the camera
negtative:this product has virtually all the same installation problems
positive:it s easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to
positive:the color and light i captured with this camera on a 12day trip to turkey  gorgeous vividly colored ceramic tiles inside darkened mosques  were far superior to anything i ve ever gotten with a traditional 35mm film camera
positive:exposure compensation in 13 stop increments  i leave it set on 13 stop to brighten up the default exposure  which goes a bit dark for my taste
positive:it will not replace your highend 35mm slr but it s a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots
positive:it s easy for beginners to use  but has features that more serious photographers will love  so it s an excellent camera to grow into
negtative:deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rdparty earphones   20   and software   25
positive:it was easy enough to remove the front plate  and there was only one way the battery could be inserted
positive:it has enough power to hog out all the material in one pass  but i usually take multiple to prevent blowout and a smoother finish
positive:gets nice sound too
negtative:the battery  as others have said  also seems weaker than creative suggests
positive:the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources  you can t do this on the ipod  except for a cumbersome workaround using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player
positive:i just bought this player today and i already love it
positive:i really liked the price
negtative:software the software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it  it does the job well
negtative:2  no games  it has a cool screen  why not use it
positive:it is currently permanently mounted  3 years now  in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot
positive:the look  feel  i have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambiance
positive:i m really happy with this purchase
positive:further  the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the ipod
positive:it is a nice router in all ways but one
positive:it is a great phone  if you are traveling all over the world  packed with wonderful features
positive:speaker phone quality is good  and poping in a 512mb mmc card  it rocks
negtative:i had never liked the idea of the diaper genie because of the refills
positive:it is nokia and thus easy to access the menu options
negtative:only if we could get one camera in it
negtative:i got about 700 loaded up before it told me i was full  and at that point  i was ready to toss it out the window
positive:it is n t big and offensive  though you would n t know it by looking at the pics it takes
negtative:they are a royal pain to install  and don t function properly once finally installed  if you can install them at all
positive:i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful
negtative:the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products  which is very dumb
negtative:the new hardware version does not run linux at all and most likely will not since the memory has been cut in half
negtative:the only beef i can raise in this regard is the popoff face  that sometimes comes off a bit easily  but besides that it s perfect
positive:accessing files by artist and album  i mostly look things up by artist  is easy and intuitive
positive:but anyway  the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing
negtative:apex does n t answer the phone
positive:the ringtones are beautiful  the screen is super high quality
negtative:1  creative mediasource software is ok to rip  catalog  burn music if you are starting from scratch   but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen  278 cds   3  400 tracks   12  5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps  and guess what
negtative:they said they would refund all the money  but a month later  they tell me now the backup disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping  15 to  handle  and ship a cd    and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails
positive:just bought one  i ve enjoyed it to date
negtative:the last problem i found with this camera was the macro function
positive:while i am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time  my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem much better than linksys
negtative:i thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time
positive:ripping  transferring tunes is basic  and pretty fast  even on a 1  1 usb
positive:very sturdy and strong
positive:we have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck  we always wrap them in the dirty diaper
positive:8  creative mediasource  although not as sleek looking as windows media player  is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cb service  gracenotes
negtative:these people takes lest effort to process rebate forms
negtative:the other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of norton systemworks before you installs this
positive:size  extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you
positive:i like to take pictures when i go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso s but i don t really care that much  i think it gives the pictures a certain reallife quality
negtative:like other reviewers  installation was hell
positive:touch ups  redeye  and so on are very easy to alter  and correct
positive:the height adjustment works well not perfect
positive:it has a nice color screen
positive:a decent camera phone for taking quick pictures  movies  and having general all around fun with
positive:all the good reviews for the sd500 are true
positive:i have had the phone for 1 week  the signal quality has been great in the detroit area  suburbs  and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky  cincinnati  i experienced perfect signal and reception along i75  far superior to at 38   t s which does not work along several long stretches on that same route
negtative:the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds
negtative:it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that s inserted  maybe 10 seconds of wait
negtative:its quiet
negtative:only thing i don t like about it is slow in changing apps  boot up  and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth
positive:handsfree future is good  but not too exciting
negtative:4 my idea was that it was an allinone  and that theory once again proves wrong  this phone ex cells at nothing  less than average in everything  if you seriously need any of the  other than phone  functionalists  you ll be disappointed     if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine     but don t expect to get much done
positive:this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong
negtative:i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds
positive:this item is exceptional i like the ease of use and it held the odor in great
positive:it was a good player when it worked and i loved the design
positive:by no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it  just be able to put a cd in the computer and it tells you what to do
positive:i have no complaints with this mp3 player
positive:i upgraded from a very small 3  2 max camera to this camera with great results
positive:i ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great
positive:i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar
positive:this is the mp3 player with everything i need  as long as it lasts me a good three years  i m satisfied
negtative:maybe this new design is more durable than the last  but i kind of doubt it
negtative:my other nit is that it didn t include at least some kind of carrying case for everything
positive:it feels tiny in the hand without it
negtative:that is  you can not access the internet at all
positive:for the hobbiest  it s probably a nice buy
positive:2  the player user interface  ui  is intuitive to use  and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection
positive:it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light
positive:could be better to be a perfect camera  and some competitors do some of this better   purple fringing  details in highlight area  noise over iso100  redeyes   few  processing artefacts   few  loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light  automatic autofocus  whizzing while videoplayback  better video compression  smaller viedofiles   more manual controls  longer lasting battery  indicator for battery  better protection of the lcd  less weight
positive:i am getting better speeds on all my web programs
negtative:i think this is it s biggest flaw
negtative:i ve had this thing for less than a month  treated it quite well  never dropped it  and the headphone jack is all screwed up
positive:it works great
positive:it s so small
positive:this new click wheel ipod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touchwheel for scrolling and clickable buttons for selection
negtative:there was neither picture nor sound
positive:for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised
negtative:i will never buy their product again at this rate  and neither should you
positive:5  its focusing system is also very flexible
negtative:too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time
negtative:it sounds decent  but i would estimate you get maybe 80  of the quality that you would from a true line out jack
positive:this wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photoquality printer  with photo quality paper
positive:if you on the other hand always use automatic settings  and not manual  you should be just fine  as the camera features some of the best automatic settings i have ever seen
negtative:this camera has a major design flaw
negtative:first of all  i ve never been big on earbuds  they re just not that comfortable
positive:i have only used it with the 14  collet and a 12  round over bit  but i love how it starts up with little torque and runs very quietly
negtative:p  s  the only snag i encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the micro to a front usb port  the bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power   after connecting it to the rear ports  it works perfectly
positive:it looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black
negtative:in fact  each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place
:
positive:the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad
positive:the setup software did everything
positive:the interface is simple to use
positive:the battery is also convenient  but could have been better  such as the zen touch s battery  but at least this one is removable
positive:allinall  its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use
positive:it s also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers
negtative:however after just one month my headphone jack was broken as a result of normal  everyday use
positive:most of the other players i checked dont have user serviceable battery
negtative:mediasource did not recognize my tags
positive:i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer
positive:yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order  with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out  it actually turns out to be really handy
positive:for the money  i m not sure you can do better
negtative:why would anyone buy this when you can get a 20gb ipod that will hold 4 times the number of songs  and even more if aac encoding is used  for the same price
positive:very simple and painless
negtative:the case is strong and stylish  but unfortunately lacks a window  now a big deal
negtative:this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks
positive:the movie mode is also working great
negtative:on my main computer the software did not work right
negtative:apple s ipod battery replacement service costs 100
negtative:bookmarks for example  are an excellent feature    but not on this player
positive:it is without even a slight doubt  my new favorite
negtative:i m currently using a sony vaio s150  which i bought at the end of this past august   and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system  in fact  i ve taken to just hibernating  rather than shutting down completely
positive:creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices
positive:sound quality on this is amazing  as with all creative products
negtative:i ve searched the program and their online tech support  worthless  and have found no solutions
positive:it is an extremely cool cozmo
positive:i was looking for something that wasn t too complicated to use and to help the pics i post on ebay show more detail
positive:however  if there was one thing i liked about the creative  it would be the car adapter
positive:the wrt54g plus the hga7t is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hardwalled house as was my case
negtative:the auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds
positive:this camera is great  wonderfully small  and has attractive hitech casing
negtative:also  diapers tend to stay in the middle  causing the pail to get backed up
positive:i loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and  very importantly  the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous
positive:it is very light weight and has a good signal strength
positive:this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities
positive:these include  mp3  wave  wma  wma pro  and wma loss less   it is very userfriendly simply by rightclicking the file  s  to be converted
positive:now that i own it  however  i can t imagine being without it
negtative:the problems i had installing norton extended way beyond what symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with
negtative:my only complaint  really more of an observation  is that the outside finish of the ipod is rather delicate  so i am going to get a case for mine so it doesn t get all scratched up
positive:so far  we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine
positive:frankly  i think this is one of the niftiest pieces of hardware i ve ever used
negtative:the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n t as easy as the ipod s  or as  sexy  looking
positive:also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player
positive:it is great sounding  even with the supplied earbuds
negtative:so loud  really  that it does n t work terribly well as a silent ringer option
negtative:the only other problem with this router that i have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick  then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated
negtative:this is only a problem at night  during the day the screen is very easy to see
positive:this phone has the best battery  it lasts longer then my old 3210
positive:i would recommend this camera unequivocally
negtative:the only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming
negtative:software is absolutely terrible
positive:also  you can store data on it  which is a plus  for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod  do n t bother  this is a much better buy
negtative:only 1 problem  no accessories    yet
positive:i can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly
positive:another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone   the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world
positive:itunes can be downloaded from the enclosed cd or for free from the apple site
positive:the camera and video functionality is decent  i can t see myself wasting my time with it  but some people will
positive:i ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because i change him so often downstairs
positive:the antivirus feature is phenomenal  and is regularly updated
positive:the sound is quite good  in terms of volume
positive:i m extremely glad i bought this camera
positive:the fact that this model would play jpeg slide shows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting
negtative:negatives of the player itself  you need to do a little work before having full enjoyment of this player
positive:on the whole  i m quite happy with the purchase
positive:the thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome
positive:uploading music is quick and easy
positive:4 looks great
positive:as the 6600 uses 900mhz  it operates in more countries than the 6620
positive:oh  and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet
positive:drops and strong signals even from the backyard
positive:picture and video quality is ok
negtative:it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long  especially if you use the flash a lot
negtative:the keypad is a decent size  but the power onoff key is small and difficult to press
negtative:cheap construction  they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners
positive:it also has tons more features then previous creative products  and most of them are very useful such as the ability to customize the main menu to show the stuff you want  not the default items  creative labs  com for more on that
positive:i m staying with sprint  and though i fear that their csr is n t nearly as good as tmobile s  the clarity of their reception is exceptional
positive:i am impressed with this camera inside and out
negtative:such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in    wrong
positive:sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about 90   the ability to record with a builtin microphone  great for recording reminders and meetings   very sturdy construction  and not to mention    the sound quality is excellent
positive:first  it really is tiny   the size of a pack of cigarettes  maybe a scotch deeper
negtative:this doesn t affect standard mp3 files  just subscription wma files
negtative:customer service and technical support are overloaded and non responsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them
negtative:i find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on
negtative:on occasion i m not able to connect to the phone with isync via bluetooth but i found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem
positive:smooth plunging mechanism
negtative:at first glance  i thought this phone was a little too big for me  maybe a little too complicated
negtative:i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason
positive:multimedia functions are enhanced by multislide mms messages and a gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone
positive:there are instructions to encrypt your personal wireless network so no one else can end up hoggingstealing your bandwidth
positive:noiseless  lightweight and oh yeah
positive:good image quality
positive:great sound  very long battery life  i routinely play it for 12  hours   very fast recharges rate  removable battery  storage size  nice screen  firmware updates  and great price
negtative:this is definitely one of those products  especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit
negtative:creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality  poor product support  difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack
negtative:the one and most major thing that i was disappointed with  in this player  is the battery life
positive:apex ad2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd  rrw and dvdr  rw  unlike sony or panasonic  one supports only  rrw and another supports  rrw
positive:four megapixels is great
positive:i particularly like the  txt  file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take
positive:as any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had simone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image appeared on the decently sized screen
positive:all the buttons  necessary lil  gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand
negtative:we bought this about 6 months ago and it s been worthless
positive:it s easy to use  and yet very feature rich
negtative:unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd
positive:this is truly a clydesdale among the industry 3hp router workhorses
positive:please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod
negtative:the scroll wheel is finicky   it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right   new users say they have 50   75  success rate   some find it so frustrating that they just return the device
positive:the display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary
positive:well  i have an ipod mini  and i really like it  but all in all  i like the zen micro more
positive:it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs
positive:all at the same time  and all without a hitch
positive:you can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby   also  we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills  like with the diaper genie
positive:the manual is easy to understand  and it is mostly idiot proof
positive:there is an opensource firmware on the net which has tons of extra features
positive:i highly recommend it
negtative:first off  the battery
negtative:after 57 pictures total the lcd went black except for the icons showing the settings
positive:the software runs smooth  it s nice to look at  it s very organized  easy to follow and makes things very simple
negtative:i know this unit will have problems in the future and the  40 for the 2 year  no questions asked  replacement warranty will be worth it  since creative will only warrant it for 90 days  which in itself is totally ridiculous
positive:i still can t believe how fast it starts up
positive:proven canon built quality and lens
positive:i can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than motorolas do  but as long as i m not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine
negtative:audio on video also lacking
negtative:they play just about everything  but  2 and  3 died very shortly after getting them
positive:5  the cheap  userreplaceable battery   50 from creative  is a great advantage over the ipod s battery which costs  100 to replace
positive:3  the nokia 6600 has a brilliant java interface
negtative:the number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area  the fonts are small  the interface is too convoluted and frustrating  it s not that customizable as well
positive:one outstanding positive feature is the battery  it holds a charge for a long time  longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup
negtative:if this machine just stops on you  unplug it quickly and get out of the way
negtative:i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it s pretty good
positive:the sound is great  the portability  etc    all the  stuff  you expect from a good mp3 player  this zen micro has it
negtative:but with a low price  comes lower quality
negtative:the thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage  except the inevitable scratches
positive:this is a must have product for all new moms
positive:i thought the software was decent enough  it was n t complicated to learn at all
positive:this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price
positive:it has great incredibility
positive:the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n t be easier to use
negtative:i took it out one day and the lcd was not working
positive:i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it
negtative:the setup process for the nomad is infuriating  and the interface with the player is subpar
negtative:yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap  replace them
negtative:my case doesnt close    maybe mine was just faulty  but the case isnt that great
positive:anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception
negtative:when the screen stops working  you re out of luck
positive:a  the picture quality  color and sharpness of focusing  are so great  it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging   how could one eat rice one grain at a time
negtative:the fine adjustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table
positive:one of the best cell phones i have ever used todate
positive:once you set it up  it s great
positive:this is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory  for example
negtative:in addition  it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player  although that may have been just the batteries that came with it
positive:pros  large hard drive for the   20gb and 40gb are both affordable
positive:i ve had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and i truely love it
positive:navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer  and vice verse  was easy too
negtative:the ipod mini is smaller and sexier  albeit limited in supported formats and the rio karma is a far better value
positive:the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them
positive:equipment included is average  but that is n t a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for
positive:while  there are flaws with the machine  the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability
positive:as i mentioned in my first paragraph  it supports wpa security  which is far superior to wep
negtative:this fixes some glitches such as the player freezing
positive:good sound  plays very nicely  even though the stock headphones are kind of weak durable  not the most durable because its mostly plastic  but very compact and sturdy
positive:the battery on mine lasts 2 days if i don t play games that much  and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat
negtative:the battery life leaves a lot to be desired
positive:i had no problems following their installation instructions
negtative:when i went to put in the new sd card i looked at the lcd screen  cracked  and the fluid gave a jackson pollock type appearance to the screen  black and blue and purple blotches and streaks  useless
positive:creative was defiantly giving the ipod a run for their money with this device
negtative:but the earbuds suck
positive:otherwise  this is a great  alternative  mp3 player for those of use who don t want to worship the mighty allpowerful apple
positive:the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging
positive:works great  no odor  and uses regular bags
positive:i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again
positive:wow  was that disappointing and we didn t even have it 6 months before it broke
positive:for a price that s still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster  and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some
positive:really easy to use
positive:this is my first digital camera  and what a  toy  it is
negtative:battery  compared to the other players on the market  the ipod has one of the worst batteries around
positive:bright  visible screen
positive:i am very pleased with its quality and durability
positive:you ll love it
negtative:i even downloaded the product s user manual  useless
negtative:negative  impossibly tiny and difficult to operate  barely visible  power button
positive:i was using the cheaper pail    and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart
negtative:i will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture
positive:great camera
positive:this holds alot and does not take up alot of space
positive:comments  overall this is still a great value  but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market
negtative:also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv
negtative:i did see the review here and other places about a cracked lcd screen
positive:i went out and got the canon today
positive:the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use
positive:i use the router with a 3 12in raised panel bit with no problems
negtative:it s oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router  activate the chuck lock  and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up
positive:it has it all
positive:i also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my aux slot in the store s sound system
negtative:i originally gave this camera 5 stars  when i had windows 98 it was wonderful but i got a new computer last november with xp the usb software is soho    not compatible with xp
positive:while the ease of use was very impressive  i was put off by the price  about  130 more than what i paid amazon for this player
positive:the diaper champ is the best we found
negtative:the software failed repeatedly
positive:if compact size is your highest priority in a 2megapixel camera  the canon powershot s100 digital elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design
positive:took hundreds of pictures and they were great
positive:i use it for ripping cds  which it does a pretty good job of
positive:also  the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree
negtative:after hooking the thing up  i found that it would only played less than 50  of the dvds i put in it
positive:it doesn t stink  ever  like some have assumed since it doesn t wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon
positive:if i had to do it over  i wouldn t buy anything else
positive:for the money apex machines have good features
positive:clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people
positive:i ve dropped it at least a dozen times to my recollection and it still works as good as ever
negtative:they have the worst service of any of the major companies
positive:the fm tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake
negtative:also if you do manage to get it installed  any problems with liveupdate or with system works will also affect the functionality andor the process of updating internet security
negtative:however  this product performed well below my expectation
negtative:the ipod comes formatted for the mac  but within seconds of plugging it into a pc  is automatically reformatted for windows   the hp version comes with windows formatting  and takes seconds to change to mac   although the ipod can be changed from one format to another  you will lose all of your music and data when doing so
positive:i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price
positive:i love the camera
negtative:my one issue with the mediasource software is that  despite pulling id3 tag data from the dds service  the ripping process fails to populate the  year  field
positive:the price  performance looked just right
positive:it s rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though i haven t had to do it yet of course
positive:the moveable lcd screen is great
negtative:i spent hours setting up the stations  accepts about 1314  i believe   though the reception is unpredictable
positive:it has several play options  one of the best is an option to shuffle  based on all or a certain playlist
negtative:yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway
negtative:i ve had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far  and i ve not to get either product working properly
negtative:what a disappointment
positive:i prefer things that are simple
negtative:the only downside i see is that it does n t look like you can manage playlists from the nomad  it has to be done from the computer
positive:the interface  while a bit confusing at first  is very easy to navigate after about 15 minutes
negtative:i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual
positive:it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use  if you read the manual
positive:excellent sound  i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox
positive:the inprogram id3 tag editing is a strong point  as well
negtative:the battery does not last 12 hours
positive:no more banner ads  popups  and the reliable antivirus
positive:this is by far the nicest one  in so many ways
negtative:otherwise  get a smaller single speed router  which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits
positive:nokia makes a great phone  that s clear
negtative:size  bigger than the ipod
positive:contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with thirdparty flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon
negtative:and the battery life is bad
negtative:i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing
positive:the pictures are tack sharp  colors are vivid  and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire
negtative:also  i can t understand why the software does not ignore  the  when it lists the cds in alphabetical order
positive:just want a wireless router for home or your very small business  you can just get a wrt54g from here and configure it
negtative:the best thing to do with this version  is to leave it on the store shelf  it doesn t work  and will cost you an enormous amount of your time  not to mention your hard earned dollars
positive:it does have a lense cap  but it wo n t let you take pics with it on which is real good
negtative:diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don t tightly wrap them first
negtative:essentially  the cd included with the package is  for the most part  worthless
positive:the zen micro  mine s black  has a lot going for it
negtative:i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n t seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as  i believe  the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked
positive:second  it is incredibly easy to use
positive:very simple to use
positive:but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player  get the nomad
positive:it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video
negtative:always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped
negtative:norton internet security 2004 is one of the more buggy implementations
negtative:the gprs web access is slow
positive:if you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday  nokia beats everyone else
positive:it plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n t be played on my old  200 sharp player
positive:i got this phone yesterday and didn t find any problems with it yet
positive:very good  every day  camera  fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos
positive:the software with the ipod includes itunes  which allows you to play the music on your computer  rip cds onto your computer  and move your music from the computer to the ipod
positive:it holds plenty of songs
negtative:other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better
positive:i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes  no crashes or problems
positive:another plus in my book  no file limits
negtative:but  the creative zen micro is plagued by a serious  serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw  and i m going to tell you what it is    but first  two more things about this piece of garbage that s so great and could ve made it a potential ipod killer
negtative:the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too
positive:better for the zen micro is outlook compatibility
positive:i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did
negtative:6  the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge   it does not charge by usb cable   this is not tragic  but usb recharging would be a convenient  additional  choice
positive:the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand
positive:i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures  purple fringing  etc  so i am very pleased
positive:the extra spare battery is just a neat bonus
positive:i really love this phone
positive:since i use it in a table  i don t use the plunge feature  but if i ever need it i ve got it
positive:i enthusiastically recommend this camera
negtative:do not buy this product
negtative:for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the caribbean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it
negtative:i downloaded this set from norton  and within minutes my internet connection failed and my pc was almost dead due to registry problems from the download
positive:the best part about this router is now i have a dhaka server
positive:creative media source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it  and the file transfers are fast
positive:the plusses are the features  look  good signal and battery life  memory size and robustness
negtative:i can t tell you how many times i ve chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it
negtative:it was  i sold it after a few months  too expensive for the shots that i got
positive:this is a benefit for many reasons   one being just for appearance  your pants wo n t be bulging with this phone in your pocket
positive:i ve since gotten the linksys modem  befcmu10  and stacked it with the wrt54g router and it works fantastic
negtative:i already knew something was wrong  because much of the spam i ve seen in the past six months was from resellers of norton products
positive:the bottom line is  phone is cool one  only for the moment  as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features  but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones
:
positive:you can use the ob ex file transfer service with bluetooth from linux  kdebluetooth provides a nice integration into conqueror for this  for sending files to the phone
positive:i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers  and they both delivered great results
positive:very comfortable camera  easy to use  and the best digital photos you re going to get at this price
negtative:it has an equalizer  but the iriver h1020gb has a lot more presets than the ipod
positive:it powers up quickly  so you won t miss that quick shot
positive:the controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed
negtative:neither message was answered  they ask for 24 hours before replying  i ve been waiting 27 days
positive:the best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking
positive:we use regular kitchen sized garbage bags
positive:i have stored 40 audio cds and i still have close to 2  8 gb free
negtative:there is absolutely nothing useful at the symantecnorton site
negtative:other than that it is all the same except the new updates
positive:i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since
negtative:after we discovered the problems  we tried to contact apex  flor 3 months   but we never got in touch with them  the customer support telephone number is always busy  and they do not answer their web customer support
negtative:i also own a canon digital rebel and i agree that the advanced controls on the sd500 are not as robust  but overall picture quality goes headtohead with the digital rebel
negtative:even the pdf manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with  mac settings   etc
positive:an extra gig of room  fm radio  voice recorder  pim applications with sync to outlook
positive:this is my first digital camera and i could n t be happier
negtative:avoid this product at all costs
positive:4  one nice thing about nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices
positive:i m very pleased with my zx so here s a quick review
negtative:the player feels very delicate  as if i m holding an actual hard drive
negtative:i mean  they re short
positive:it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar
positive:i ve had a lot of cameras  but this one is actually being used  and not stored in a desk  it s all ways in my shiest pocket
positive:this one has a color display  which i like a lot  being very visual
positive:the touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon t slip which was very thoughtful
positive:way to go apple
positive:first 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor
positive:there seem to be fewer collisions and dropped packets as i read from the router logs than with my old dlink router
negtative:overall  a very disappointing product
positive:its just as fast as the included creative software  but much less invasive  and overall better looking
negtative:have tried calling  8664apexgo   but can t get through
positive:i like the speak phone function a lot
positive:i love the slim design   the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky
positive:i m sure you can read the specs above to see everything it does  but for me the best thing is that i can easily check my email  movie times  news  or any website with this phone
negtative:it s as though nokia has segregated 90 of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10 for the day to day use
negtative:it had locked up multiple times previously  but always managed to work after wards  this time  the touch screen wouldn t respond to me and none of the buttons worked
negtative:it would not hang up on calls
negtative:es  the interface took a little getting used to  but once i did  it s almost second nature now
positive:finally  compare the ipod to other players on a costgb  and also consider ease of use
positive:i also had no problems installing or running the camera software on my pc
negtative:start up  log off  log on    everything became very slow
positive:besides the one problem  this machine is amazing
positive:however  this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes
positive:you do get 1 more gb than an ipod mini
positive:and  with the ipods  full volume up  all you have to do is adjust your receivers  volume and your set  since the ipod itself acts as a strong amp lifer of its  own
positive:service is great as far as i can tell  features work like a charm  ringtones are high quality if you buy them from tmobile and aim is great
positive:this did n t bother me too much because it s still a decent size
positive:i decided to go with the diaper champ rather than the more popular diaper genie  because i didn t like the idea of having to buy special bags
positive:you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well  sound presets  navigating options  playlists  etc
negtative:even after reading some of the instructions  it s still hard to figure out
positive:i do give create to creative for their attractive design
positive:i could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point  but this pr duct seems to work very well so far
positive:great camera  great investment
negtative:i will never buy a creative product again
positive:but from my experience  by the time it gets to that point  the bag is really heavy  so i think this is kind of helpful it s a builtin way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying
negtative:the installation software cd crashed repeatedly
negtative:first  the sound quality is okay  but  as at least one other reviewer has mentioned  the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes
negtative:the pictures are a little dark sometimes
negtative:warning   the windows  remove program  feature does not do a good job of this  and neither does norton s own removal program
positive:i use a nokia 6600  it has a great color tft display and camera equipped with zoom  which complement a builtin video recorder with audio and a real one player for playback and streaming of 3gppcompatible and real media video clips
positive:a very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years
positive:the controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use
positive:enjoy
positive:the extra gb is just a bonus
positive:i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up
positive:first and foremost  it will take better pic s than most film camera s
positive:transferring files couldn t be easier thanks to the included software bundle
positive:overall  i feel that it s a decent buy  and am happy that i own it
negtative:no proprietary headset jack
negtative:the flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to
