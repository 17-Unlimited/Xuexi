3:the film is faithful to what one presumes are the book 's twin premises -- that we become who we are on the backs of our parents , but we have no idea who they were at our age ; and that time is a fleeting and precious commodity no matter how old you are .
1:one of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation .
3:it takes this never-ending confusion and hatred , puts a human face on it , evokes shame among all who are party to it and even promotes understanding .

4:the film is darkly funny in its observation of just how much more grueling and time-consuming the illusion of work is than actual work .

1:to be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed .
3:interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of carmen

0:-lrb- director -rrb- o'fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short .
4:a zinger-filled crowd-pleaser that open-minded elvis fans -lrb- but by no means all -rrb- will have fun with .

4:on this tricky topic , tadpole is very much a step in the right direction , with its blend of frankness , civility and compassion .
3:while not for every taste , this often very funny collegiate gross-out comedy goes a long way toward restoring the luster of the national lampoon film franchise , too long reduced to direct-to-video irrelevancy .

3:finally , the french-produced `` read my lips '' is a movie that understands characters must come first .
1:imperfect ?
